"""Regenerate manifest.json with current file hashes.

Run after editing any SKILL.md / reference file. Reads the per-skill
metadata (description, version, min_server_version) from the existing
manifest.json and only refreshes the file list + sha256 map. If you
need to bump a skill's version or min_server_version, edit
manifest.json by hand first, then run this script — it will preserve
your edits.
