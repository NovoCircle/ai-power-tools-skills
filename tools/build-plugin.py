"""Package the plugin as `dist/ai-power-tools.plugin` for the Cowork channel.

Claude Code installs this plugin from the marketplace, which pins the released
copy of this tree in the releases repository (see tools/publish-plugin.py,
which reads its tree out of the archive built here). Cowork does not read that
marketplace: the desktop app
enumerates Cowork's plugins itself from its own stores, one of which is fed by
an in-app upload that accepts a `.zip` or `.plugin` archive. This script builds
that archive.

A `.plugin` IS a zip -- the desktop normalises the extension before validating
it -- with the plugin's own contents at the archive root, so `.claude-plugin/`
sits at the top level.

The skill content is not copied or transformed: both channels ship the exact
bytes under `plugins/ai-power-tools/`, so there is one source of truth and no
way for the two to drift. `version_problems` and `plugin_files` are imported by
publish-plugin.py for the same reason.
