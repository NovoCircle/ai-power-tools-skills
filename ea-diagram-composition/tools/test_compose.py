"""Tests for the pure-arithmetic layout engine.

Run from the repository root:

    python -m pytest ea-diagram-composition/tools/test_compose.py -q

Nothing here touches a repository, a COM object or the filesystem. If any test
in this file needs Sparx EA to pass, the layer boundary has been broken.

Two conventions worth reading before editing:

* `assert_no_overlaps` is applied to comparable sets - all items together, all
  containers together - never to items and containers mixed. Items are nested
  inside their containers by design, so a mixed set is supposed to overlap.
* Rect intersection is tested in EA's flipped-y convention, where `top` is
  greater than `bottom`. `test_overlap_helper_*` pins that first, because every
  other no-overlap assertion in the file leans on it.

# Every visible layout defect this engine has shipped was a CONTENT-VARIATION
# sensitivity that one hand-picked case passed: a ragged band edge that needed
# unequal sibling counts, a name collision that needed long names, unequal radial
# spokes that needed non-square boxes, and a ring clearance derived from
# `max(w, h)` where the condition is `hypot(w, h)`, which overlapped at every
# count of three or more. So the properties below are swept over item counts,
# height profiles, box widths and gaps rather than demonstrated once.
#
# The height profiles are the axis that matters here, because variable heights
# are what this grammar is for. `odd-parity` exists for the integer rounding:
# seating a box in its slot divides an odd difference, and a profile whose
# differences were all even would never exercise it.
