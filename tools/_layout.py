"""Where a manifest path's file actually lives in this repository.

Manifest paths are INSTALL-relative: the installer writes each one straight
under the skills directory, and publish-bundle derives the flat release-asset
name from the same string. Neither says anything about where the file sits in
the repo -- and since the skills moved under the plugin, the two differ.

Shared by regen-manifest.py, gate.py and publish-bundle.py. It lived in all
three as a private copy first, which is one update away from a release that
stages the wrong tree.
