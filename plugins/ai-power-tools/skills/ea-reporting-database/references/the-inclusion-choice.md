# The inclusion choice

What a reporting build includes beyond the MDG is the user's decision, made once, shown with
counts, and saved. Nothing downstream second-guesses it. Every figure below is an illustration
from a small Westbrook Bank-shaped fixture; substitute your own technology, stereotypes and
model.

Code: `../../_shared/tools/inclusion.py`. It is pure: rows in, plain data out. Its tests run with
`python -m pytest ../_shared/tools/test_inclusion.py -q` and need no EA.

---

## 1. The three options

| # | Option | What the build holds |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Only what my MDG defines** | The MDG's element stereotypes and connector stereotypes. Nothing else |
| 2 | **Everything in the repository** | Option 1, plus every observed element key and connector key |
| 3 | **Show me the gaps** | Option 1, plus the gaps the user includes; each gap is included, excluded, or sent to the MDG skills |

"Observed" is keyed the way the build keys it, and the choice is only meaningful in those terms:

| | Key | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Element, bound to a profile | the `FQName` | `BMM::Goal` |
| Element, ad hoc | stereotype text and metaclass | `VendorApplication` on `Component` |
| Element, no stereotype | metaclass alone | `Requirement` |
| Connector, bound | the `FQName` | `BMM::Influences` |
| Connector, ad hoc | the stereotype text | `extends` |
| Connector, no stereotype | the base type | `Association` |

A stereotype counts as the MDG's only when it is **bound to the MDG's profile namespace**. The
same name carried ad hoc, or bound to another language, is a gap, never the declared stereotype.
A connector's key drops the base type, so one stereotype on two base types is one key.

---

## 2. Run the census, then analyze

Both censuses come from the same `t_xref` rows (`ea_census.build_stereotype_index`); the rows the
censuses were taken from go to `analyze` as well, because it needs a name to show for each gap and
the metaclass of unstereotyped elements.

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, r"<skills-dir>/_shared/tools")
from ea_census import build_stereotype_index, census_elements, census_connectors
from inclusion import analyze, resolve_answer, new_since_saved

index = build_stereotype_index(xref_rows)
a = analyze(census_elements(objects, index), census_connectors(connectors, index), mdg,
            objects, connectors)          # namespace= if it cannot be inferred
```

`a.options()` gives option 1 and option 2 by count; `a.gaps` is the option 3 list; `a.unbound_connectors`
and `a.multi_stereotyped` are the defects of §3.

`Coverage` holds, per option: declared and observed **element keys**, distinct **elements**,
declared and observed **connector keys**, and **connectors**. An element in two tables counts once
in `elements`. Counts are of keys and instances, not tables: how many connector tables a key
yields depends on the allowed source and target combinations, which the build decides.

Unstereotyped diagram furniture (`Package`, `Note`, `Text`, `Boundary`) is not model content and
never gets a table, so it is neither counted nor offered as a gap.

---

## 3. Two data defects, which are not gaps

A gap is a question for the user. These are mistakes in the repository, fixed there.

**A connector bound to no profile.** Its stereotype is qualified text (`WBA::Flows`) but no
`FQName` binds it, so EA never recorded the binding. **The preflight stops.** `resolve_answer`
refuses to produce a profile for any option while one exists. The defect carries the fix:

- the MDG declares the stereotype: `update_connector` with `StereotypeEx` set to the qualified
  name, `<profile namespace>::Flows`;
- it declares no such stereotype: clear `StereotypeEx`, or have the MDG skills declare it.

Take a baseline first (`ea-change-management`); this writes to the model. Then re-run the census.

**An element with two declared stereotypes.** It is flagged, with the count and the combination.
If the user continues, it is placed in **both** tables - pass
`continue_with_double_stereotypes=True`. Without that, `resolve_answer` refuses. An element
carrying one declared stereotype and one from another language is ordinary and is not flagged.

---

## 4. Ask the question

Put all three, with the counts, every time a profile is created. Say what option 3 offers in
numbers too: how many element keys and connector keys are gaps and how many elements and connectors
they hold. For each gap show the key, its count and the example name, so the user can recognize it.

Then record the answer:

```python
answer = resolve_answer(a, 1)                 # or 2
answer = resolve_answer(a, 3, {gap.id: "include" | "exclude" | "update_mdg" for ...})
profile["inclusion"] = answer.inclusion       # exactly the profile's inclusion section
profile["inclusion_choice"] = answer.record() # stored beside it; see §5
```

`answer.inclusion` is `{"observed_elements": "all" | [{"stereotype", "metaclass"}, ...],
"observed_connectors": "all" | [<connector key>, ...]}`. Option 1 is two empty lists; option 2 is
`"all"` twice. A gap id is `element:<key>` or `connector:<key>`.

**"Update the MDG" is a hand-off, not an answer.** Declaring the gap is the MDG skills' job
(`ea-mdg-model-build`); the census reruns afterwards and the gap is then declared, so it is no
longer a gap. `resolve_answer` treats it as not decided and refuses to produce a profile while any
gap is undecided or marked for an update. Say so, hand off, re-run the census, ask again.

After the answer the metamodel is fixed. Do not re-open the choice mid-build.

---

## 5. What the profile cannot remember

The profile lists only what is included. A gap the user **excluded**, and which option was chosen,
are not in it, so by itself a refresh could not tell "excluded" from "new". Store
`answer.record()` beside the profile (`inclusion_choice`; the server ignores unknown keys). It holds
the option, the excluded gap ids, and what the MDG declared at the time.

---

## 6. Refresh: flag, never decide

On every refresh, re-run both censuses and call:

```python
for item in new_since_saved(a, profile["inclusion"], profile.get("inclusion_choice")):
    print(item.kind, item.key, item.count, item.example, item.detail)
```

It reports, and decides nothing:

- `new_element_key` / `new_connector_key` - a gap not in the saved lists and not excluded (option 3
  only: option 1 is a deliberate "MDG only" and option 2 already covers everything);
- `mdg_stereotype_added` / `mdg_stereotype_removed` / `mdg_version_changed` - the MDG is not what it
  was when the choice was made.

Show these to the user and ask. A new ad hoc connector stereotype added after setup is reported as
`new_connector_key` with its count and an example, and the build uses the saved choice until the
user answers. The unbound-connector stop of §3 applies on every refresh as well.

If there is no saved record, the option is inferred: `"all"` on both sides is option 2, anything
else is option 3 and every unlisted gap is reported.
