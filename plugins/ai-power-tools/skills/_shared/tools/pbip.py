"""Author a complete `.pbip` project from a semantic model.

PURE. No file or network I/O, no clock, no randomness. It returns every file in
the project keyed by its relative path; writing them is the caller's job.

    SemanticModel + partition source  ->  project_files()  ->  {path: text}

All three Power BI paths use this. `APT-2026-0211` passes a `ParquetSource`
pointing at the files the reporting database emitted, `APT-2026-0212` one
pointing at files emitted straight from EA, and `APT-2026-0230` a `SqlSource`.
The project is otherwise identical, which `test_pbip.py` asserts.

THE CALLER MUST WRITE WITH `newline=""`
---------------------------------------
Every string here is CRLF-terminated, UTF-8 without a BOM, because that is what
Power BI writes and a generated project that deviates is rejected. On Windows
`open(path, "w")` would turn our "\\r\\n" into "\\r\\r\\n".

THE REPORT HALF IS WHERE THIS GETS HARD
---------------------------------------
The semantic model is straightforward. The report is validated just as strictly
and its failures are far less readable. Two measured ones, both of which cost
real time:

  * `reportVersionAtImport` as a STRING aborts the open with a precise message
    and Power BI loads NOTHING. It is an object: {visual, report, page}.
  * A `report.json` carrying only `$schema` opens the semantic model but fails
    the report with an opaque activity id - and then EVERY SAVE PATH CRASHES
    with a null reference, so the project cannot be saved at all even though its
    model loaded perfectly.

So this replicates the structure of a project Power BI itself wrote, read off
disk, rather than the minimum that seems reasonable.

A BASE THEME IS REQUIRED, AND IT CAN BE OURS
--------------------------------------------
MEASURED 2026-10-02 on Power BI 2.158.1177.0, three opens of the same 40-table
model:

  * No `themeCollection` and no `resourcePackages`: the semantic model loads and
    the REPORT fails - "Something went wrong / Failed to load the report", whose
    details are an activity id and nothing else.
  * The theme block plus Power BI's own theme file: opens clean.
  * The theme block plus a MINIMAL THEME OF OUR OWN - a name, a handful of
    colors - opens clean too.

So the theme is required, and shipping someone else's file is not. `base_theme`
defaults to `default_base_theme()`, whose JSON this module emits itself. Passing
`base_theme=None` omits it, which is known to produce a project whose report
does not load; it exists so the failure can be reproduced, not for ordinary use.

Which PART is strictly required - the `themeCollection`, the `resourcePackages`
entry, or the file - has not been isolated. All three were added together.

THE OVERVIEW PAGE AND ITS VISUALS (APT-2026-0545)
-------------------------------------------------
The one page carries a table visual over `Table Directory` (`table_name`, `kind`,
`description`) and one card per entity count measure (`'{table} count'`). No visual
uses an entity table's columns, so the blank member that Power BI adds to a table
on the one side of a relationship never shows. The JSON follows the `visualContainer`
2.14.0 files Power BI Desktop 2.159.883.0 itself saved (a `tableEx` and a `slicer`
in a captured PBIR project): `$schema`, `name`, `position`, `visual` with a
`query.queryState.Values` projection list, and, on the table, the per-column
`filterConfig` Desktop writes. A card is the same container with `visualType` "card"
and a `Measure` field. Cards carry no `filterConfig` (the captured project has no
card to copy it from, so none is guessed). Every `name` is derived from the content,
as `page_name` is.

Versions pinned, from the captured project: visual container 2.14.0 (the captured
visuals; `VISUAL_SCHEMA`), page 2.1.0, report 3.3.0, pages metadata 1.1.0, version
metadata 1.0.0. Only the visual container changed from what was pinned before.
`REPORT_VERSION_AT_IMPORT` stays {visual 2.13.0, report 3.4.0, page 2.3.1}: Desktop
2.159.883.0 saved 2.14.0 visuals and left that object as it was, so it is an import
record, not a pin that tracks the container schema, and Desktop has never written
2.14.0 there.

The page is 1280 wide and 720 high, and grows taller only when the cards need it
(more than about 136 entity tables), so every card sits on the page.
