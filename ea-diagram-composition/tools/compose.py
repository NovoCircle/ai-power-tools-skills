"""Pure-arithmetic layout engine for composed diagrams.

This is the code corner of the diagram-composition skill. It turns a plain-data
description of what belongs on a diagram into rectangles, and does nothing else:
no repository calls, no COM, no file or network I/O, no clock, no randomness.
Same input, same output, every time.

Modeling-language specifics do not belong in this file. Sizes, spacing, wrap
widths and label areas arrive in a `spec` dict supplied by the caller - in
practice from a per-language binding held as data. There is no branch here on a
technology id, a profile name or a stereotype, and adding one would be a design
error: the arithmetic of a band of boxes is the same whatever notation the boxes
are eventually drawn in.

Coordinate convention
---------------------
Sparx EA's diagram coordinates are not the usual screen coordinates, and getting
this backwards silently corrupts everything downstream.

    left, right   positive, increasing rightward       right > left
    top, bottom   NEGATIVE, increasing upward          top > bottom

So:

    width  = right - left
    height = top - bottom          <-- not bottom - top

A real element placed by EA 17.1: left=50, top=-50, right=190, bottom=-110. That
is 140 wide and 60 tall. Moving an element DOWN the diagram makes both `top` and
`bottom` MORE negative. The visual top of a diagram is the coordinate nearest
zero, which means "the topmost rect" is the one with the LARGEST `top`.

Every rect this module produces obeys that convention, and `rects_overlap` is
written for it. Build rects with `rect()` rather than by hand.

Grammars implemented here
-------------------------
`compose_layered_bands` - horizontal bands stacked top to bottom, items laid out
left to right inside each band, wrapping to further rows when a band is wider
than the wrap width.

`compose_lanes` - swimlanes: parallel tracks, each carrying a sequence of items
that flows along the lane. Items at the same sequence index across different
lanes line up on the flow axis, which is what makes a handoff readable.

`compose_nested_grid` - containers within containers, each laid out as a grid of
its children. Containment is the only structure; there is no sequence and
usually no connectors. This is the one that takes a recursive tree rather than a
flat list of groups.

`compose_radial` - a hub and its spokes: items distributed on a ring around a
center, optionally with a further ring hanging off each one. The one grammar
here whose arithmetic is trigonometric, so it is also the one that has to be
careful about rounding: coordinates are rounded once, at the end, so the same
ring comes out identically on every machine.

`compose_two_column_cycle` - a cycle drawn as two columns: the flow runs down
one and back up the other, closing the loop across the top. The one grammar here
whose items may be different HEIGHTS, because on the content it is for the height
is the number of lines inside the box; the width is shared so that the cycle
still has a straight outline. Its row pitch is a floor, widened to clear the
tallest box, and the pitch used comes back on the result.

All five take plain lists of dicts and return plain dicts. No classes to
construct, nothing to subclass.

Result shape
------------
    {
      "grammar":    "layered_bands" | "lanes" | "nested_grid" | "radial"
                    | "two_column_cycle",
      "items":      [ {"id", "left", "top", "right", "bottom", ...}, ... ],
      "containers": [ {"id", "name", "kind", "index", "left", "top", "right",
                       "bottom", "label": {...}}, ... ],
      "bounds":     {"left", "top", "right", "bottom", "width", "height"},
    }

`items` are nested inside their `containers` by design, so test the two sets for
mutual disjointness separately - an item is supposed to sit inside its band.

For `nested_grid`, containers nest inside CONTAINERS too, so even the container
set is not mutually disjoint there: compare siblings, not the whole set.

`radial` returns no containers at all, and an item's `container_id` names the
ITEM it hangs from - the hub, or the spoke it branches off. It also carries
`center` and the `radius` actually used, which can exceed the one asked for.
That radius is the CLEAR GAP between the box at the middle and the boxes on the
ring, not the distance to an item's center: the items sit at whatever distance
makes that gap equal for all of them, so do not expect them to share one.

`two_column_cycle` returns no containers either, and its items' `container_id` is
None: a cycle is a ring of peers with nothing enclosing them, and nothing it
places hangs off anything else. It carries `rows`, `columns`, `row_pitch`,
`column_pitch` and `item_width` - the pitch is a floor and may have been widened.

    as a mistake in the drawing rather than as a fact about the content. It is
    the one defect that every arithmetic check passes: nothing overlaps, every
    rect is positive, the bounding box is right, and the picture still looks
    wrong. So the widest band's demand sets the width and the rest are drawn to
    it, with the slack left empty inside them.

    THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE NESTED GRID DOES, and the difference is
    deliberate - do not tidy the two into agreement. There, a container keeps
    the size its contents need and is NOT stretched to fill its cell, because a
    grouping of four SHOULD be drawn bigger than a grouping of two: the size is
    the information, and snapping them to a common cell drew both at the same
    size and lied about where the weight was. Here the size is not information.
    A band is a full-width strip across the diagram, standing for a layer that
    spans it; how many items happen to populate the layer is already shown by
    the items, so spending the band's width on it says nothing and costs the
    straight edge. The rule is per grammar because the meaning of the rect is
    per grammar.

    Note what is NOT shared: a band's HEIGHT still follows its own contents, so
    a band of twelve wrapped over three rows is visibly taller than a band of
    one. The vertical axis is where this grammar carries its meaning.

    `bands` is an ordered list, first band at the top:

         {"name": "Applications", "items": [...], "item_width": 180}]

    A band may carry `id` (used as its container id) and may override
    `item_width`, `item_height`, `h_pitch`, `row_pitch`, `wrap_width` and
    `label_height` for itself. Items carry `id` (required) and optionally
    `name`, which is passed through to the result.

    Behavior worth knowing:

    * Items run left to right, stepping by `h_pitch`, wrapping to a further row
      once a row would exceed `wrap_width`.
    * Every item in a band is the same size. Different bands may differ.
    * **Every band is the same WIDTH** - the widest band's - so the stack has one
      straight right edge. See `_common_band_width` for why this grammar shares
      a width where the nested grid deliberately does not.
    * A band's HEIGHT still follows its contents. Bands step down by
      `band_height + band_gap`, or by `band_pitch` if that is larger - which is
      how a configurable vertical pitch and content-driven height coexist.
    * An empty band keeps its label row rather than collapsing to nothing.
    * `align` is "left" (default) or "center", and governs where a ROW sits
      inside its band's content area. It no longer moves the bands themselves:
      they share a width, so they already share both edges.

    may carry `id` and may override `item_width` and `item_height`.

    The invariant that earns this grammar its keep: **items at the same sequence
    index across different lanes line up on the flow axis.** Index 2 in every
    lane occupies the same slot, so a handoff from one lane to another reads as
    a step across rather than a step diagonally. Each slot is as long as the
    longest item at that index in any lane, and each item is centered in its
    slot; `slot_start` and `slot_extent` come back on every item so a caller can
    check the alignment itself.

    Other behavior worth knowing:

    * Lane thickness follows the largest item in that lane, across the lane.
    * Items are centered across the lane's thickness.
    * A lane's label area is reserved inside its container rect and returned as
      `label`; the container rect covers the whole lane, label included.
    * `lane_gap` defaults to 0, so lanes abut the way swimlanes normally do.

    * An empty lane is valid and still gets a label area and its minimum

    """Lay out containers within containers, each as a grid of its children.

    `nodes` is the top level of a recursive tree. A node carrying `items` is a
    container and needs a `name`; a node without `items` is a leaf and needs an
    `id`:

        [{"name": "Retail", "items": [
            {"name": "Onboarding", "items": [{"id": 101}, {"id": 102}]},
            {"id": 103}]},
         {"name": "Payments", "items": [{"id": 104}]}]

    Containment is the only structure this grammar expresses. There is no
    sequence and usually no connectors - a nesting that also needs arrows to be
    read is a graph, and one of the other grammars or EA's own layout will serve
    it better.

    Behavior worth knowing:

    * **Grids come out close to square** - `ceil(sqrt(n))` columns - because a
      grouping rendered as one long row reads as a list and loses the grouping.
      Set `grid_columns` to fix a count; a container may set its own.
    * **Cell sizing is uniform within a level and may differ between levels.**
      Item size is stated by the PARENT (`item_width`, `item_height`, overridable
      per container for its own direct children, not cascading), so sibling
      leaves cannot disagree about their size - the one thing that most makes a
      generated diagram look machine-made.
    * **Containers are sized by their contents and nothing else.** A container
      with twenty children is visibly bigger than one with two - which is the
      whole point of drawing the grouping - so a container is NOT stretched to
      fill its cell, and a row of containers can end at different depths. Cells
      are still sized by the widest and tallest member of their column and row,
      so siblings never collide; the slack simply stays empty. A leaf keeps its
      exact size, centered in its cell.
    * **Padding is constant** (`grid_pad`) on every side, with the title strip
      (`label_height`) as an extra inset at the top, so a container's own name
      never sits on top of its children.
    * **Depth is bounded and a deeper tree is REFUSED**, not warned about:
      `max_grid_depth` defaults to 3 levels of containment. A warning would need
      a channel in the result that nothing reads; an error names the offending
      path, and a caller who genuinely wants four levels raises the bound
      deliberately. Leaves may sit at any level, including inside the deepest
      container.
    * An empty container keeps its label and one cell of space rather than
      collapsing, so the emptiness is visible and the author has to mean it.

    Item ids must be unique across the whole tree, as in the other grammars, and
    a container `id` may not collide with another container's or with an item's -
    both are mapped back onto model elements. Root-level leaves come back with
    `container_id: None`, since nothing encloses them.

    Returns the result dict described in the module docstring, with `depth`,
    `row`, `column` and `parent_id` on containers and `depth`, `row`, `column`
    and `container_id` on items. Raises `LayoutError` for any input that cannot

    A ray leaving the box's center at `degrees` (clockwise from twelve o'clock,
    as everywhere else here) leaves through either a horizontal or a vertical
    side, whichever it reaches first. Scaling the half-extent by the ray's
    component on that axis gives the distance to each candidate side, and the
    nearer one is the side actually crossed:

        horizontal sides, at half the height:  (h / 2) / |cos(degrees)|
        vertical sides,   at half the width:   (w / 2) / |sin(degrees)|

    76.2 - the half diagonal - through a corner. Which is exactly the spread
    that used to show up as unequal spokes: a box CENTERED on the ring pokes
    only 30 back toward the hub at the top and a full 70 at the side, so it
    stands off at the top and bottom and crowds the hub at the sides.

    A ray exactly along an axis has a zero component on the other one, so that
    candidate is dropped rather than divided by: at least one component of a
    unit vector is non-zero, so there is always a side left to cross.

    Note this measures along the RAY, which is not the same as the nearest point
    of the box to the center - for a box crossed near a corner the corner itself
    is closer. Along the ray is the right measure anyway, because a spoke is

    `nodes` is the ring, in order. `hub`, when given, is the thing at the

    as a container, because it is one of the things on the diagram rather than

    A node carrying `items` gets its own outer ring, laid out over the arc it
    occupies, which is what turns a hub-and-spoke into a radial tree.

    Behavior worth knowing:

    * **Angles run clockwise from twelve o'clock**, which is how a reader
      describes one of these. `start_angle` moves the first item.
    * **`sweep` is how much of the circle to use**, 360 by default. A smaller
      sweep gives a fan rather than a ring, and the items are spread across it
      INCLUSIVE of both ends - a 180-degree sweep of three items puts one at
      each end and one in the middle, which is what a half-circle of three is
      meant to look like. A full circle does not repeat the first position.
    * **Uniform sizing within a ring.** Stated by the parent, so siblings
      cannot disagree - the same rule the other grammars follow.
    * **Every spoke is the same length.** `radius` is the CLEAR GAP between the
      box at the middle and the box on the ring - the part of a spoke that gets
      drawn - not the distance to an item's center. Each item is pushed out by
      however far its own border reaches along its own ray, and by however far
      the box at the middle reaches along the same ray, so the gap between the
      two comes out equal all the way round whatever shape the boxes are. Item
      centers therefore do NOT all sit at one distance: see `_place_ring` and
      `_reach`.
    * **The radius is a floor, not a promise.** If the items would collide at
      the radius given, the ring is widened until they do not, and the radius
      actually used comes back on the result. A grammar that produced a
      deliberately overlapping ring because the caller passed a small number
      would be obeying the letter of the spec and drawing a bad diagram.
    * **Depth is bounded** by `max_ring_depth`, default 2, and a deeper tree is
      REFUSED rather than warned about - the same decision the nested grid
      makes, for the same reason: the result dict has no channel a warning
      could travel down that anything reads.

    THE CONNECTORS ARE NOT THIS GRAMMAR'S JOB, and for these diagrams that
    matters more than usual. Reference radial diagrams commonly use curved or
    arced connectors; the routing vocabulary available here has no arc, so a
    generated equivalent will carry straight or Bezier lines. The geometry is
    equivalent; the drawing is not identical, and saying so is part of using
    this grammar honestly.

    THE ONE PLACE IN THIS MODULE WHERE AN ITEM SIZES ITSELF, and the reason is
    not convenience.

    Every other grammar here refuses per-item sizing, on the rule stated in
    `_band_metrics`: a row of boxes at four different sizes reads as four
    different kinds of thing even when it is one kind. That rule is about
    variation that means NOTHING. A state carrying four lines of entry behavior
    is taller than a state carrying none because it holds more, exactly as a
    nested-grid container holding twenty children is bigger than one holding
    two, and forcing those to one height either clips the content or pads every
    box to the worst case. So the height here is content and is per item.

    The WIDTH is the opposite case and is shared by the whole cycle - see
    `compose_two_column_cycle`. Width carries nothing: a compartment wraps, and
    two columns of unequal width give the cycle a bent outline for no reason a
    reader could decode. Uniform where the size says nothing, per item where it
    says something, which is the same test `_common_band_width` applies and not
    a relaxation of it.

    A caller that states any OTHER spec key on an item is refused rather than

    step from the bottom of one column across to the bottom of the other, a
    horizontal hop at every count. For an odd count the empty cell is therefore
    the TOP of the return column, and the step that closes the loop is the
    diagonal one.

    That is a choice between two diagonals and it is worth recording which way
    it went, because both are defensible and nothing else in the code says so.
    One of the two turns HAS to be diagonal at an odd count: anchor the return
    column at the top instead and the closing step comes out horizontal while
    the fold comes out diagonal. The fold is an ordinary step in the sequence
    and wants to read as "and now across"; the closing step is already

    `container_id` is None.

    WHAT IT GUARANTEES, GIVEN THAT THE BOXES ARE DIFFERENT HEIGHTS
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Variable heights are the point of this grammar rather than an awkwardness it
    tolerates: the diagrams it is for put multi-line entry and do behavior
    inside a box, and a box with four lines of it is taller than a box with
    none. A grammar that assumed one height would either clip that content or
    pad every box to the worst case. So three things are promised and a fourth
    is deliberately not:

    * **One WIDTH for every item**, `item_width`, and one column pitch. Both
      columns therefore have a straight left and a straight right edge, and the
      cycle has a rectangular outline. Width carries no information here - a
      compartment wraps - so spending it on content would be variation a reader
      has to decode for nothing. This is `_common_band_width`'s argument applied
      to the other axis.
    * **One row PITCH for the whole composition**, the tallest item plus
      `item_gap_y`. Equal pitch is the property a reader sees as rhythm, and it
      is the property the shipped linter measures: its spacing rule judges a
      column of unequal boxes on its CENTER-to-center pitch, so a scheme whose
      pitch followed each row's own tallest member would report as unevenly
      spaced however tidy it looked.
    * **Aligned CENTERS, not aligned tops.** Each item is centered in its row's
      slot, which is the pitch less the gap. Centers are what makes the pitch
      uniform - see the derivation below - and what makes the fold and the
      closing step come out horizontal, since row r in the left column and row r
      in the right column share a center line to within a unit of integer
      rounding. Aligning TOPS instead would leave the center pitch varying by
      half the difference between successive heights, which on the content this
      grammar is for is tens of units.
    * **NOT one size.** Two items of different heights are different sizes, so
      do not hand the whole cycle to the linter's uniform-sizing rule as a
      single role: that rule compares heights as well as widths and would read
      the content as a defect. Declare a role per height - the rule is explicit
      that the caller decides what a role is, and that two elements can share a
      place on the diagram and still be different roles. The shared width is the
      uniformity this grammar promises, and it is the part worth checking.

    THE CLEARANCE CONDITION, DERIVED RATHER THAN EYEBALLED
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Write `P` for the row pitch, `g` for `item_gap_y`, `S = P - g` for the slot
    height, and `h`, `h'` for the heights of two items in adjacent rows of one
    column. `S` is at least the tallest item by construction. An item is
    centered in its slot, so its top sits `(S - h) // 2` below the slot top, and
    the vertical clearance between the two is

        P - h - (S - h) // 2 + (S - h') // 2
          = g + ceil(a / 2) + floor(b / 2)       where a = S - h, b = S - h'

    which is **never less than `g`** whatever heights sit next to each other,
    and grows when either box is shorter than the slot. Non-adjacent rows are
    further apart again by at least one pitch. Across the columns the clearance
    is `h_pitch - item_width` at every row, so two items in different columns
    never overlap on the horizontal axis and their rows do not matter.

    That is the whole condition: two exact inequalities rather than a margin.
    Note which of the three ways of seating an item in its slot the derivation
    picked and why - top-aligned gives `g + a` and bottom-aligned gives exactly
    `g`, so all three clear, and centering was chosen for the PITCH property
    above and not for clearance. Getting that backwards is how a clearance rule
    ends up justified by the wrong quantity.

    Behavior worth knowing:

    * **`row_pitch` is a FLOOR, not a promise.** The tallest item is content,
      not spec, so a caller cannot be expected to state a pitch that clears it.
      A pitch too small for the tallest box is widened and the pitch actually
      used comes back on the result, the way `compose_radial` reports the radius
      it used. `h_pitch` is NOT treated that way: it and `item_width` are both
      spec values, so a pitch narrower than the width is the caller
      contradicting themselves and is refused.
    * **An odd count leaves the TOP of the return column empty**, so the fold at
      the bottom is horizontal and the closing step is the diagonal one. See
      `_cycle_split`.
    * **A cycle of one or two composes.** One item is a self-loop and two is a
      pair, both of which are real if unusual; neither is worth an error, and
      `columns` on the result says which happened.
    * The connectors are not this grammar's job, and that is worth saying out
      loud for a cycle: the arrangement is what makes the loop legible, but
      nothing here draws the loop. Route the vertical steps down each column,
      the fold across the bottom and the closing step back to the first item.

    Returns the result dict described in the module docstring, plus `rows`,
    `columns`, `row_pitch`, `column_pitch` and `item_width` - what it actually
    did, since the pitch may have been widened. Items carry `index` (position in
    the cycle), `column`, `row` and `leg` ("descent" or "return"). Raises
    `LayoutError` for any input that cannot yield sane geometry.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Grammars that live in their own modules

# THE IMPORT IS AT THE BOTTOM ON PURPOSE, AND MOVING IT UP BREAKS THE BUILD.
# Each of these modules imports this one's public primitives (`LayoutError`,
# `rect`, `bounding_box`), so importing them at the top would be a cycle: this
# module would still be executing and those names would not exist yet. Down
# here everything this file defines is already bound, so the cycle resolves -
# `compose` is in `sys.modules` and complete enough for them to read.
#
# They are re-exported rather than left standalone because `bindings.py` derives
# what is IMPLEMENTED by reading `dir()` on this module for `compose_*` names.
# A grammar in its own file and not named here is a composer that exists and
# that nothing can find - which is exactly the "existing and reachable are
# different properties" trap this programme has hit four times.
