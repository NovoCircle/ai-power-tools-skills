"""Check a generated diagram before anyone is shown it.

This is the check half of the generate-check-correct loop. It consumes exactly
what `verify_diagram` returns and makes no repository calls of its own, so it
can run anywhere the verify payload can be carried.

LANGUAGE-NEUTRAL BY CONSTRUCTION
---------------------------------
Every rule reads geometry and presentation - rects, sizes, routes, fills - and
nothing reads the metamodel. No notation name, no technology id, no element
classification branches anything here. That is what lets one linter serve every
modeling language, including one nobody has written a binding for: "these boxes
overlap" and "these connectors cross needlessly" are not metamodel questions.

The module is held to the same bar as the layout engine, and a test enforces it
over identifiers AND string constants - including these docstrings. Naming a
language even in prose is how the first special case gets justified later.

The same property is why this module does not import `bindings`. A binding's
presentation profile is translated to a plain mapping by the CALLER and handed
in as `profile=`; see `PROFILE_KEYS`. A test asserts the import is absent,
because the boundary is the design.

WHAT A CLEAN REPORT MEANS
-------------------------
"No defect this linter knows how to measure." It is NOT a claim that the
diagram reads well. Known blind spots are listed in
`references/verification.md` and kept there deliberately, so that a clean
report is never quoted as more than it is.

EA COORDINATES
--------------
`top` and `bottom` are negative and `top > bottom`, so `height = top - bottom`.
`_normalize_rect` is the only function here that reasons about it; everything
else works in the conventional top-left-origin space it returns.

# layouts the composition engine actually produces - 6300 of them, counts 2 to

#
# * ROUNDING puts the worst spread of the angular steps between neighbors at
#   0.78 degrees. That is the cost of placing a center on whole units.
# * A NUDGE is larger. EA moves geometry by a few units, and 4 units is the
#   nudge this file already tolerates as a size (SIZE_TOLERANCE). The tightest
#   center-to-center distance any of those layouts produces is 132 units, where

#   ways move one step by 3.47.

# 4 covers the nudge with the rounding inside it. The defects this exists for

# boundary sits anywhere in (3.5, 60), and 4 is taken from the noise end

    equality - EA nudges geometry and exact equality would be noise.

    BOTH AXES, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SAME QUESTION TURNED NINETY DEGREES
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    `axis` is one of `STACK_AXES`: `"horizontal"` is a row read left to right,
    whose spacing is measured along x, and `"vertical"` is a column read top to
    bottom, whose spacing is measured along y. `lint_diagram` supplies it from
    which of its own two arguments the group arrived in - `rows=` or `columns=` -
    so a caller states a column by passing one, never by an axis string.

    For a long time only x was measured, and the cost was exact: a column passed
    as a row has every x gap equal to the same negative number, so the spread is
    zero and a column at wildly uneven vertical spacing reported clean. The
    server's own distribute operation shipped with the same defect and for the
    same reason, and it now does both axes because they are orthogonal.

    WHAT IS MEASURED DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE GROUP IS UNIFORMLY SIZED
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    For a group of equally sized elements, the edge-to-edge GAP is measured.

    For a group whose elements differ in size ALONG THE READING AXIS, the
    CENTER-TO-CENTER pitch is measured instead. That is not a loosening: a flow
    that puts a 30-wide event next to a 110-wide activity has a rhythm the
    reader perceives as the even spacing of centers, and both the edge gaps and
    the leading edges necessarily vary around it. The two measures are identical
    for equal sizes. Size is taken along the reading axis - widths for a row,
    heights for a column - because that is the dimension that makes the gaps
    vary.

    EVERY GROUP GETS A FLOOR ON THE GAP ITSELF
    ------------------------------------------
    Even spacing says nothing about whether the boxes touch, and the floor is
    the rule for that. It applies on BOTH paths, which it did not always:

    * Mixed sizes. Widths alternating `a, b, a, b` with `a + b = 2 * pitch`
      drive EVERY edge gap to zero while the center spread stays at zero.
    * Uniform sizes. Eight equal boxes butted edge to edge have eight gaps of
      zero, and the spread of eight zeros is zero. This is the case the floor
      used to miss, and it is the THIRD time the touching exemption has hidden a
      spacing defect here: a whole row with no whitespace in it scored
      completely clean.

    Leaning on `check_no_overlaps` to bound either one does not work, because
    touching is exempt from the overlap rule by design - a band and its contents
    legitimately share an edge.

    WHY THAT DOES NOT PUNISH DELIBERATE ABUTMENT
    --------------------------------------------
    Bands, lanes and pools abut on purpose, and a rule forbidding all touching
    would be wrong. The floor is not that rule: it judges only a group the
    caller PASSED AS A ROW OR A COLUMN, and declaring one is the statement that
    its members are laid out with spacing between them. Containers that abut
    deliberately reach this module as a `stacks=` grouping instead, and no rule
    here measures the gaps between a stack's members. So the scope is the
    declaration, not the geometry and not the element type: the same two boxes
    are a defect as a row and correct as a stack, and only the caller knows
    which they are.

    A wrapped row is TWO rows and the caller passes it as two. Compensating
    here would paper over that and lose the single mis-spaced element this rule
    exists to catch.

    `pitch_groups_measured` IS THE DENOMINATOR for `worst_pitch_spread`, which
    is 0 both for evenly spaced rows and for no rows at all. Both accumulate
    across the two axes, so calling this twice on one report - which is what
    `lint_diagram` does - reports the worst of both and counts all of them.

    """Containers stacked one after another should share a cross-axis extent.

    `stacks` is a list of `(axis, members)` pairs, both stated BY THE CALLER.
    `axis` is one of `STACK_AXES`: `"vertical"` is a stack read top to bottom,
    whose members should share a WIDTH, and `"horizontal"` is a stack read left
    to right, whose members should share a HEIGHT. This module does not decide
    which boxes form a stack or which way it runs - that is a composition fact
    the generator knows, and a rule that inferred a stack from coordinates would
    fire on any diagram that merely happens to look stacked.

    THE DEFECT NO OTHER RULE SEES
    -----------------------------
    A band sized to its own contents is narrower when it holds fewer items, so
    bands of three, three and two leave the stack with a ragged edge. Every
    per-element and per-pair rule passes: nothing overlaps, every row is evenly
    spaced, every item matches its role. This is the first rule about a
    container's EXTENT rather than about its members.

    Judged against `SIZE_TOLERANCE` and not a constant of its own, because it is
    the same claim - "these are one size" - made about containers rather than
    items, and EA nudges a container's geometry exactly as it nudges an
    element's. No calibration against a real stack exists to justify a
    different number, and inventing one would be a claim this file cannot back.

    A WARNING, not an error. A stack whose extents differ is not wrong the way
    an overlap is: a tapering stack is a legitimate composition. But it is the
    caller who declares a stack, and declaring one is the statement that its
    members are peers, so a difference is worth a look.

    WHAT IT REFUSES TO JUDGE
    ------------------------
    Only the extent is compared. Members that agree on width but start at
    different left edges are staggered rather than ragged, and that is
    `check_stack_alignment`, not this rule. Nor does this say anything about the
    gaps between members, which is a spacing question. A stack of fewer than two
    is skipped, and an axis outside `STACK_AXES` is reported on `not_run` rather
    than guessed at.

    THE DEFECT NO OTHER RULE SEES
    -----------------------------
    Containers of identical size, at different offsets across the stack, so the

    Judged against `SIZE_TOLERANCE` and not a constant of its own. Alignment is
    the strictest of the claims this file makes - boxes either line up or they do
    not - so it takes the tightest tolerance already here, which is the one that
    exists to absorb EA's own few units of nudge. No real staggered stack has
    been measured to argue for a different number, and inventing one would be a
    claim this file cannot back.

    A WARNING, for the reason `ragged-stack` is one: a deliberate indent - an

    look.

    Only the leading edge. Where a member ENDS is its extent, which is
    `check_stack_extents`, and the gaps between members are a spacing question no

    reason it cannot say which boxes form a stack - see `check_stack_extents`.
    A radial tree is several rings, one per hub, and is passed as several.

    THE DEFECT NO OTHER RULE SEES
    -----------------------------
    Placing each item's CENTER on a circle around the hub does not place its
    EDGE there. A wide flat item at the top or bottom of the ring reaches
    toward the hub by only half its height; the same item at the side reaches
    by half its width. So a flat item stands off from the hub at the top and
    bottom and crowds it at the sides - unequal spokes - while every item is
    correctly on the circle, nothing overlaps, and every per-element rule
    passes.

    WHAT IS MEASURED
    ----------------
    The length of the spoke as the reader sees it: the straight line from the
    hub's center to the item's center, less the stretch inside the hub and the
    stretch inside the item. Both stretches are found by running that line out
    to each box's border, so a diagonal spoke is measured on the diagonal, not
    on one axis. A hub that is not square gets its own unequal reach for the
    same reason an item does, and that is counted too.

    The SPREAD, largest minus smallest, is judged against `PITCH_TOLERANCE`
    rather than against equality. It is the same claim `check_pitch_consistency`
    makes about a row - evenly spaced - made about a ring, and it has the same
    reason to tolerate a nudge. No calibration against a real ring exists to
    justify a separate constant.

    A WARNING. Unequal spokes make a ring look uneven and are never a
    correctness problem; a diagram can be read perfectly well from one.

    WHAT IT REFUSES TO JUDGE
    ------------------------
    Angular spacing - whether the items are evenly spread around the ring - is a
    different question, and it is `check_ring_angles`, not this rule. Neither
    rule says whether the ring is circular, or whether the spokes cross other
    items. An item whose center coincides with the hub's has no direction, so it
    is left out rather than given one; a ring with fewer than two measurable
    items has no spread.

    THE DEFECT NO OTHER RULE SEES
    -----------------------------
    A ring squeezed into a third of its circumference. Every spoke is the same
    length, nothing overlaps, every item matches its role, and
    `check_ring_spokes` says in as many words that the angle is not its question
    - so a ring of three at 0, 100 and 200 degrees, which should be at 0, 120
    and 240, scored completely clean.

    THE SWEEP IS THE CALLER'S TO STATE, AND WITHOUT IT THIS DOES NOT RUN
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    A ring is passed as `(hub, items, sweep)`, with `sweep` in degrees. Three
    items bunched into 200 degrees and three items fanned evenly across 200
    degrees ARE THE SAME GEOMETRY; the only difference is how far round the ring
    was meant to go, and that is a composition fact the generator holds. A rule
    that assumed a full circle would report every deliberate fan, and a fan is
    what a partial sweep is for. So a ring passed as a plain `(hub, items)` pair
    lands on `not_run` and is not judged.

    Only whether the ring CLOSES is read off the number - a sweep of 360 or more
    closes it - because the spread of the observed steps is what is judged, and
    that needs no expected step. This module therefore holds no copy of the
    engine's angular arithmetic to drift away from.

    WHAT IS MEASURED
    ----------------
    The bearing of each item's center from the hub's, sorted around the circle,
    then the step from each item to the next. A closed ring's steps include the
    one from the last item back to the first, which is what makes a bunched ring
    show up: the items' own steps can be perfectly even while the way back is
    half the circle. A partial ring has an opening instead of that step, and
    `_steps_without_the_opening` drops it.

    The SPREAD is judged against `ANGLE_TOLERANCE`, which is in degrees and is
    calibrated against the layouts the engine produces - see the constant. A
    WARNING: a bunched ring looks lopsided and is never a correctness problem.

    WHAT IT REFUSES TO JUDGE
    ------------------------
    Evenness only. A fan that fills a quarter of the sweep it declared, evenly,
    is clean - how much of its sweep a ring should occupy is a composition
    choice, not a defect. Spoke length is `check_ring_spokes`. A closed ring
    needs two measurable items and a partial one needs three, because the first
    step it can compare against is the one the opening is not.

    `profile` is a plain mapping of presentation settings - see `PROFILE_KEYS`.
    It suppresses the rules a view deliberately makes moot, and the suppressed
    rule ids come back on the report so that a suppression is visible rather
    than silent.

    `roles`, `rows`, `columns`, `stacks` and `rings` are the caller's grouping:
    which elements play the same role, which sit in the same row, which sit in
    the same column, which containers form a stack and which way it runs, which
    boxes ring which hub. Those are composition facts the generator knows and
    geometry alone does not, and guessing them here would invent the metamodel
    this module deliberately does not have. Omit them and the rules that need
    them simply do not run.

    `rows` and `columns` are both lists of groups and are judged by the same
    rule on the two axes - a caller who already passes `rows` does not have to
    restructure to declare a column, it passes `columns` as well. `stacks` is
    `[(axis, containers), ...]` with `axis` in `STACK_AXES`. `rings` is
    `[(hub, items), ...]`, or `[(hub, items, sweep), ...]` to have the angular
    spacing judged too; see `check_ring_angles` for why the sweep cannot be
    inferred.

    WHEN A GROUPING IS OMITTED, NOTHING IS SAID ON `not_run`, and that is
    deliberate: an entry per unused grouping would put three lines on every
    ordinary diagram, and a list that is noisy on correct output is a list
    nobody reads. The absent metric key is the signal there. `not_run` is for a
    grouping the caller DID declare and the rule could not judge - an unknown
    axis, a ring with no sweep, or groups that are all too small to compare
    anything within - because that is the case where a clean report has checked
    less than it looks.
