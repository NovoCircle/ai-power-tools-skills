# Class-Level Modeling — Attributes, Operations, Parameters

Detail supporting [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) §4 (element creation). Read that section first for
the create-element decision points; this file covers the next layer down — attributes,
operations, and operation parameters on an already-created element.

All calls are `ea_model(operation="<name>", params={...})`.

---

## 0. The identifier map — read this before calling anything here

Attributes and operations each expose **two different identifiers** in every response
(`create_*`, `list_*`, `update_*` all return both). Which call needs which one is not
consistent, and guessing wrong fails immediately with `missing_required_params`:

| Object | Small int field | GUID field | `update_*` wants | `delete_*` wants |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Attribute | `attribute_id` (= `t_attribute.ID`) | `guid` (= `t_attribute.ea_guid`) | `attribute_guid` | `element_id` + `attribute_id` |
| Operation | `method_id` (= `t_operation.OperationID`, **not** `t_method`) | `guid` (= `t_operation.ea_guid`) | `method_guid` | `element_id` + `method_id` |
| Parameter | `parameter_id` — always **`null`** in every response (see §4) | `guid` (= `t_operationparams.ea_guid`) | no dedicated update op exists | no dedicated delete op exists |

**Confirmed live, both objects:** `update_attribute` takes `attribute_guid`; `delete_attribute`
takes `element_id` + `attribute_id`. `update_operation` takes `method_guid`; `delete_operation`
takes `element_id` + `method_id`. Same split, same shape, on both object kinds — this is not a
one-off inconsistency, it's the pattern. Expect it to bite the first time you write generic
"update this thing I just created" code that assumes one id serves both calls.

Where the ids come from in practice:
- **Right after `create_attribute` / `create_operation`:** both ids are in the response already
  — no extra call needed.
- **Any other time:** call `list_attributes` / `list_operations` (§3) and read `attribute_id` /
  `guid` (or `method_id` / `guid`) off the row you want. Match by `name`, since there is no
  find-by-name for attributes or operations.

`t_operation` is the real EA table (`OperationID` primary key). **`t_method`** also exists in
this schema (`describe_table("t_method")` returns it) but is unrelated to operations — it has
only `Object_ID, Name, Scope, Type` and no id column at all. Don't be misled by the name; the
tool's `method_id` field is an `ea_model` naming choice, not a pointer into `t_method`.

## 1. Worked sequence

Carrier elements per canon (`_shared/references/westbrook-example.md` §2): `WBADataAsset` and
`WBAAIModel` are both declared **Class** metaclass, and that is the metaclass
`create_element_in_language` resolves for each.

### 1a. Create the carrier element

```python
ea_model(operation="create_element_in_language", params={
    "package_id": pkg_id,
    "name": "CustomerRiskProfile",
    "language_id": "WBA",
    "language_type": "WBADataAsset",
})
# -> "resolved_object_type": "Class", "resolved_stereotype": "WBADataAsset",
#    "definition_source": "model"
```

> **Pass the registered technology id.** `WBA` is what EA registers and what
> `create_element_in_language` resolves against; `WestbrookBankArchitecture` is the display name
> of the profile inside it. Check the id with `ea_mdg(operation="get_mdg_from_runtime",
> params={"tech_id": "WBA"})` — the stereotype list it returns is read out of the technology EA
> has loaded, and `definition_source` on the creation response echoes where the resolution came
> from.

The same call creates every other carrier the technology declares, `WBAAIModel` included:

```python
ea_model(operation="create_element_in_language", params={
    "package_id": pkg_id,
    "name": "FraudScoringModel",
    "language_id": "WBA",
    "language_type": "WBAAIModel",
})
# -> "resolved_object_type": "Class", "resolved_stereotype": "WBAAIModel"
```

Everything below (attributes, operations, parameters) works identically regardless of which path
created the element — these operations key off `element_id`, not off how the element was made.

### 1b. Attributes — with type and default

```python
ea_model(operation="create_attribute", params={
    "element_id": elem_id,
    "name": "assetId",
    "type": "String",
    "properties": {"Default": "UNSET"},
})
# -> {"ok": true, "attribute_id": 2, "guid": "{...}", "name": "assetId",
#     "type": "String", "default": "UNSET", ...}
```

**The default value MUST go through `properties={"Default": ...}`.** A top-level `"default"` or
`"default_value"` keyword argument is silently accepted by the call (no error, no entry in
`rejected_properties`) but never reaches `t_attribute.Default` — the field comes back empty. This
was confirmed by creating three attributes with a top-level `default`/`default_value` argument
(all persisted with `Default = ""`), then one with `properties={"Default": "US"}` (persisted
correctly), then fixing one of the broken ones after the fact with `update_attribute` +
`properties={"Default": "UNSET"}`. Use the raw EA column name inside `properties` for anything
beyond `name`/`type`/`element_id` — same pattern as `update_element` elsewhere in this skill.
`Default`, `Type`, `Scope`, and `Const` are reserved words in `t_attribute` (bracket them in raw
SQL, but that doesn't apply to the `properties` dict keys — those are just the column names).

### 1c. Operations — with a return type

```python
ea_model(operation="create_operation", params={
    "element_id": elem_id,
    "name": "validate",
    "properties": {"ReturnType": "Boolean"},
})
# -> {"ok": true, "method_id": 2, "guid": "{...}", "name": "validate",
#     "return_type": "Boolean", "parameters": [], ...}
```

`Notes` works the same way (`properties={"ReturnType": "void", "Notes": "..."}` in one call).
Note the response key is `return_type` (snake_case, normalized) while the property you set it
with is `ReturnType` (EA's raw property name) — the tool renames on the way out but not on the
way in.

### 1d. Parameters

```python
ea_model(operation="add_parameter", params={
    "element_id": elem_id,
    "method_id": 2,
    "name": "strict",
    "type": "Boolean",
})
```

**This call throws on every invocation observed, but the write usually still lands.** See §4 —
read it before you retry on error, because a naive retry can duplicate work in the one case where
it doesn't land, and is a no-op (safe) in the case where it does.

---

## 2. What `list_attributes` / `list_operations` return, and how to read them

```python
ea_model(operation="list_attributes", params={"element_id": elem_id})
```

Returns an **array**, one dict per attribute, each shaped exactly like a `create_attribute`
response:

```json
[
  {"attribute_id": 2, "guid": "{DC3E...}", "name": "assetId", "type": "String",
   "default": "UNSET", "visibility": "Public", "notes": "", "stereotype": "",
   "is_static": false, "is_const": false, "is_collection": false, "container": "",
   "containment": "Not Specified", "lower_bound": "1", "upper_bound": "1",
   "classifier_id": 0, "parent_id": 9459}
]
```

`list_operations` is the same shape per-operation, plus a nested `parameters` array:

```json
[
  {"method_id": 2, "guid": "{D9F1...}", "name": "validate", "return_type": "Boolean",
   "notes": "", "visibility": "Public", "stereotype": "", "is_static": false,
   "is_abstract": false, "concurrency": "Sequential", "code": "", "behavior": "",
   "parent_id": 9459,
   "parameters": [
     {"parameter_id": null, "guid": "{B2A7...}", "name": "strict", "type": "Boolean",
      "kind": "in", "default": "<none>", "notes": "", "position": 0}
   ]}
]
```

Reading it:
- There is **no `find_attributes_by_name` / `find_operations_by_name`.** To get an id or guid for
  an attribute/operation you didn't just create, call `list_attributes`/`list_operations` for the
  owning element and filter by `name` yourself.
- Order matches EA's internal `Pos` column — the order the browser would show, not creation
  order if any have been reordered since.
- `parameter_id` is **always `null`.** Don't treat this as "the parameter creation failed" — it's
  a fixed field on every parameter row regardless of outcome (see §4). Use the parameter's `guid`
  or its `name` (unique per operation — see §4) if you ever need to refer back to one.
- An unset attribute/parameter default reads back as `""` immediately after creation in the tool
  response, but as the **literal string `"<none>"`** if you read it back later (via
  `update_operation`'s echo, or via raw SQL on `t_operationparams.Default` /
  `t_attribute.Default`). `<none>` is EA's own placeholder text for "no default set", not a bug in
  the wrapper — but the inconsistency between what a fresh create response shows (`""`) and what
  a later read shows (`"<none>"`) is worth knowing before you write a check like
  `if default == "":`.

## 3. Failure modes actually hit

### 3a. `create_attribute` / `add_parameter` silently drop a top-level `default`

Covered in §1b. Symptom: call returns `ok: true`, `rejected_properties: []` (nothing was
rejected — the key just wasn't recognized), and the value never appears in the model. Fix: put it
in `properties={"Default": ...}`.

### 3b. `add_parameter` throws `AddNew.ParameterID` — but the parameter is usually already written

Reproduced on every single call made during verification (5/5), including:
- Two different operations on two different elements.
- A parameter with a `type`, one without.
- `type` passed top-level and via `properties={"Type": ...}`.
- A brand-new operation created seconds earlier (rules out "operation must be committed first").

The raw error text is `Error executing tool ea_model: AddNew.ParameterID` — an unhandled COM-level
exception, not a validated `{"ok": false, ...}` response. Despite the exception, `list_operations`
called immediately after showed the parameter present with the `name` and `type` (when given)
correctly stored, every time. What did **not** persist: any `Default` passed via `properties`
alongside the failing call — the column reads back as EA's literal `<none>`, i.e. never set,
regardless of what was requested.

**Practical handling:**
1. Call `add_parameter`. Expect it to throw.
2. Immediately call `list_operations` for the owning element and confirm the parameter is there
   under the `name` you gave it. It almost certainly is.
3. Do **not** blind-retry `add_parameter` on a *different* name to "try again" — if step 2 already
   shows it, a second call under a new name creates a second, unwanted parameter.
4. A retry under the **same** name is safe either way: `t_operationparams`' primary key is
   `(OperationID, Name)`, so EA overwrites in place rather than duplicating — confirmed by issuing
   two `add_parameter` calls for the same operation and parameter name and finding exactly one row
   afterward.
5. The MCP `add_parameter` operation does not set a default value. EA does, through COM, and
   it persists:

   ```python
   p = operation.Parameters.AddNew("count", "int"); p.Update()
   p.Default = "42"; p.Update()
   ```

   Use this (see the **ea-com** skill) rather than writing to `t_operationparams` directly —
   a supported API is always preferable to raw SQL against EA's schema.

### 3c. `create_element_in_language` fails outright for a stereotype the technology doesn't declare

`unknown_language_type` is a hard stop, not a partial write — nothing is created. Check
`ea_mdg(operation="get_mdg_from_runtime", params={"tech_id": "WBA"})` first if a `language_type`
you expect might not be one the loaded technology declares.

### 3d. There is no `update_parameter` or `delete_parameter`

`ea_model`'s operation list (confirmed by calling each with empty `params` and reading the
`valid_operations` list back in the error) has no dedicated parameter update or delete call.
`add_parameter` is the only parameter-mutating operation, and it's an upsert-by-name (§3b point
4). To remove a parameter, either recreate the owning operation or drop to raw SQL
(`DELETE FROM t_operationparams WHERE OperationID = ? AND Name = ?`) — there is no MCP-level
delete for this one object kind, unlike every other object covered in this file.

### 3e. `execute_sql` can time out on a live, shared repository

One verification query (`t_operation` joined to `t_operationparams` with no `WHERE`) timed out
outright while EA was in active use elsewhere. Scope SQL verification queries with a `WHERE`
clause on a known `Object_ID`/`OperationID` rather than joining broad tables unfiltered, especially
against a repository other sessions may also be touching.

---

## 4. Verification checklist for a new attribute/operation

After any create or update, don't trust the echoed response for anything you didn't explicitly
set — confirm with a targeted `list_attributes`/`list_operations` call, or SQL scoped to the one
`element_id`/`OperationID` you touched:

```sql
SELECT ID, Object_ID, Name, [Type], [Default] FROM t_attribute WHERE Object_ID = <element_id>;
SELECT OperationID, Object_ID, Name, [Type] FROM t_operation WHERE Object_ID = <element_id>;
SELECT OperationID, Name, [Type], [Default] FROM t_operationparams WHERE OperationID = <method_id>;
```

`[Default]`, `[Type]`, `[Scope]`, `[Const]`, `[Kind]` are reserved words across these tables —
bracket them in raw SQL (see `ea_analyze("describe_table")` for the full reserved-word list per
table).
