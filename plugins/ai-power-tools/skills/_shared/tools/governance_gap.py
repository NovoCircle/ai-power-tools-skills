"""Elements that would be left out of the reporting database, and what to do.

PURE. No repository calls, no COM, no file or network I/O, no clock, no
randomness. It takes rows already extracted plus the technology's declared
shapes and returns findings; applying anything to a model is the caller's job.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
An element with no stereotype lands in no entity table. Once the database is
restricted to logical business objects (APT-2026-0226) it is simply absent, and
nothing tells the customer. Measured on the reference model, three Components
carry the complete governance tag set - criticality Business-Critical,
regulatoryScope GLBA, both owners, data classification - and no stereotype at
all. A Business-Critical, GLBA-scoped platform that no report can see.

So the build asks BEFORE it generates, not after.

WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES TO DO
------------------------------
Rank candidates it cannot tell apart. On the reference technology twelve of the
fourteen stereotypes declare an identical six-tag set, so tag overlap scores all
five plausible Component stereotypes at exactly 1.0. Returning the
alphabetically-first one dressed as a recommendation would be a guess wearing a
number.

Three outcomes, kept distinct on purpose:

  NO_CANDIDATE  the technology extends no stereotype for this metaclass, so
                there is nothing to apply. Fifteen Nodes on the reference model.
                The answer is to extend the technology - which is R1's job - or
                to accept the exclusion. Never a suggestion.
  RANKED        one candidate is backed by evidence the others lack, and the
                evidence is stated with it.
  UNRANKABLE    candidates exist and nothing distinguishes them. List them,
                refuse to order them, let the customer choose.

`report_model.detect_multi_value_candidates` sets the precedent in this
toolchain: "a CANDIDATE list, never an instruction."

THE SIGNALS, IN THE ORDER THEY DISCRIMINATE
-------------------------------------------
1. Base metaclass. A hard filter, not a tiebreak. It eliminates every candidate
   for a Node and narrows a Component to seven.
2. Package locality. What stereotype do this element's stereotyped neighbors
   carry? This is what actually decided the three real cases on the reference
   model, where three siblings in the same package were all the same stereotype.
3. Tag signature. Weak as a discriminator because the declared sets collide, but
   it does one useful job: an element carrying only the common tags should not
   be offered a stereotype that declares four more it does not have.
