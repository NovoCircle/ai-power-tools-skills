"""Layout grammar: `radial_tree` - a mind map.

A central topic, branches radiating from it, sub-branches hanging off those,
for as many levels as the content has. This is the shape of an EA mind-mapping
diagram: one box in the middle carrying the question, a handful of main topics
around it, and the actual content hanging off the main topics.

Same contract as the rest of the composition engine: plain data in, rectangles
out. No repository calls, no COM, no file or network I/O, no clock, no
randomness. Same input, same output, every time. EA's coordinate convention -
`top` negative and increasing upward, `height = top - bottom` - is the module
docstring of `compose.py`; every rect here obeys it and is built with that
module's `rect()`.

WHY THIS IS NOT `compose_radial`
--------------------------------
`compose_radial` places a ring of items around a hub and gives every branch the
SAME slice of the circle: the slice is `min(step, 120)` where `step` is the
sweep divided evenly by the number of branches. That is right for a hub and its
spokes, where the branches are peers and any second ring is decoration. It is
wrong for a tree, because a tree is not evenly distributed: a branch with eight
children needs more angular room than a branch with one, and an even split
wastes the room on one side while forcing the crowded side out to a radius that
drags the whole diagram with it. Measured, with the shipped defaults: a hub of
twelve branches, one of them carrying eight children and the rest one each,
comes out of `compose_radial` at 1746 x 3399 units, almost all of that height
being the one crowded branch shoved outward until its fixed 30-degree slice
could hold eight boxes.

Three further things differ, and together they are why this is its own grammar
rather than a flag on that one:

* **Angular room is allocated by WEIGHT, not by count** - see `_assign_wedges`.
* **Depth is not capped at two.** A mind map with three levels below the
  central topic is ordinary; `compose_radial` refuses past two rings, and
  correctly so for what it draws.
* **Branches cannot interleave, structurally.** Each node owns a closed
  interval of bearings and every descendant is placed inside it, so two
  top-level branches can never trade children. `compose_radial` centers a
  branch's ring on the branch and gives it a fixed width regardless of what its
  neighbors were given, so its branches only stay apart when the arithmetic
  happens to work out.

WHAT IS KEPT FROM `compose_radial`, DELIBERATELY
------------------------------------------------
`radius` means the same thing here: the CLEAR GAP from the parent box's border
out to the child box's border, along the child's own ray - the part of the
spoke a reader actually sees drawn - and NOT a center-to-center distance. Every
child of one parent therefore sits at its own distance from that parent's
center, and the visible spokes all come out the same length. That property is
what `lint.check_ring_spokes` measures, and it is the reason this grammar does
NOT put each level on a concentric circle the way a textbook radial tree would:
concentric levels make the drawn spokes from one parent to its children vary by
however much the fan is bent, which is exactly the defect that rule exists to
catch. Level-uniform radii would read fine and lint dirty; equal clear gaps read
fine and lint clean, so equal clear gaps win.

The trigonometry is duplicated from `compose.py` rather than imported from it.
`_reach`, `_min_reach` and `_polar` here are the same functions by construction
and are kept in step by the tests, not by an import: this module is meant to
stand alone, and reaching into another module's underscore names to get it
would couple the two in the one direction neither wants.

    """Share one ring's angular room out among its branches, then recurse.

    THIS IS THE DESIGN, so it is written down rather than left to be recovered.

    A tree does not distribute evenly around a circle. Splitting the sweep by
    the NUMBER of branches gives a branch with eight children the same room as a
    branch with one, which wastes the circle on one side and crowds it on the
    other. So each branch is given a WEDGE - a closed interval of bearings -
    whose width is proportional to the number of LEAVES beneath it, and its own
    children are then given sub-wedges of that wedge by the same rule. A branch
    sits on the BISECTOR of its own wedge, so its subtree is balanced about it.

    WHY LEAVES AND NOT NODES
    ------------------------
    What consumes angular room is boxes competing for the same arc. At any one
    depth, the number of boxes a subtree contributes is at most its leaf count,
    and at the deepest depth it is exactly its leaf count - a subtree's leaves
    are its widest generation, because every interior node has at least one
    child. So leaf count is the tight bound on the worst generation and a valid
    bound on every other one. Weighting by total node count instead would pay
    angular room to interior nodes, which sit at smaller radii where a degree
    buys less arc and there is less competition for it anyway; weighting by
    depth would ignore width, which is the thing that actually collides.

    WHY THE WEDGES CANNOT INTERLEAVE
    --------------------------------
    A child's wedge is a subinterval of its parent's, and siblings' wedges are
    disjoint by construction, so two nodes from different branches never share a
    bearing. That is a property of the allocation, not of the arithmetic
    working out, which is the difference between this and centering a
    fixed-width fan on each branch.

    `max_branch_sweep` caps how much of its own wedge a node spends on its
    children, centered on its own bisector. A cap can only make a child's span

    """Lay out a mind map: a central topic, branches, and sub-branches.

    `nodes` is the list of main branches, in clockwise order. A branch carrying
    `items` gets its own sub-branches, recursively, to `spec.max_tree_depth`.
    `hub`, when given, is the central topic - `{"id": ..., "name": ...}` - and
    is placed as an item rather than as a container, because it is one of the
    things on the diagram rather than something enclosing them:

        compose_radial_tree(
            [{"id": 1, "name": "Paperless Office",
              "items": [{"id": 11}, {"id": 12}, {"id": 13}]},
             {"id": 2, "name": "Day One Functionality"},
             {"id": 3, "name": "Inventory Management",
              "items": [{"id": 31}, {"id": 32}]}],
            hub={"id": 100, "name": "Stakeholder Needs"},
        )

    Behavior worth knowing:

    * **Angular room goes by weight.** Each branch owns a wedge whose width is
      proportional to the number of leaves in its subtree, and its children own
      sub-wedges of that wedge. A branch with eight children gets eight times
      the room of a branch with one. See `_assign_wedges` for why leaves.
    * **Angles run clockwise from twelve o'clock**, and `start_angle` is the
      bearing of the FIRST branch - its wedge is centered on that bearing.
    * **A partial `sweep` is NOT inclusive of both ends**, which is where this
      differs from `compose_radial`. The sweep is divided into wedges and each
      branch sits at its wedge's center, so a 180-degree sweep of three equal
      branches puts them at 30, 90 and 150 degrees rather than at 0, 90 and 180.
      Reaching the ends would mean the end branches' wedges hung half outside
      the sweep, and their children with them.
    * **Uniform sizing within a ring.** Stated by the parent, so siblings cannot
      disagree - the rule the other grammars follow. A node may restate
      `item_width`, `item_height` and `radius` for its OWN children; it does not
      cascade to grandchildren.
    * **Every spoke from one parent is the same length.** `radius` is the CLEAR
      GAP between a parent's box and its children's boxes - the drawn part of a
      spoke - not a center-to-center distance. Levels are therefore NOT
      concentric circles around the middle: see the module docstring for why
      that trade was made deliberately.
    * **The radius is a floor.** Each ring is widened until its own branches
      cannot touch, by the diagonal condition in `_size_rings`.
    * **Overlap-freedom is checked, not merely argued.** Disjoint wedges keep
      branches apart in BEARING, but a child is placed from its parent's center
      rather than from the middle of the diagram, so its bearing as seen from
      the middle drifts toward its parent's. The drift is bounded - a node's
      bearing from the middle always stays inside its top-level branch's wedge -
      but it is not bounded tightly enough for a closed form to size the deeper
      levels from. So the composition is laid out, tested for collisions, and
      every clear gap widened by a fixed step until it is clean. `gap_scale`
      on the result says how much widening it took; 1.0 means the floors were
      already enough, which is the usual case.
    * **Depth is bounded** by `max_tree_depth`, default 4, and a deeper tree is
      REFUSED rather than warned about.

    THE CONNECTORS ARE NOT THIS GRAMMAR'S JOB. Reference mind maps commonly join
    a branch to its children with curved lines; the routing vocabulary available
    here has no arc, so a generated equivalent carries straight or Bezier lines.
    The geometry is equivalent; the drawing is not identical, and saying so is
    part of using this grammar honestly.

    Returns the result dict described in `compose.py`'s module docstring, with
    `containers` empty and an item's `container_id` naming the ITEM it hangs
    from - the central topic, or the branch it grew off. Items also carry
    `ring` (0 for the central topic, 1 for a main branch, and so on), `angle`,
    `wedge` and `leaves`, so a caller can reason about the allocation without
    recovering it from coordinates. Raises `LayoutError` for any input that
    cannot yield sane geometry.
