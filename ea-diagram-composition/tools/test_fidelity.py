"""Tests for the fidelity comparison.

The fixture is a SYNTHETIC reading with the character of a hand-placed diagram:
three classes down the left, each with a note to its right on a dashed link, plus
a heading and a banner note across the top. Its boxes are deliberately NOT
aligned and NOT evenly spaced - widths differ by a few units, left edges differ,
vertical gaps differ - because that raggedness is the property this whole module
exists to preserve, and a tidy fixture would let the conflict with the linter go
untested.

Synthetic on purpose. Readings taken off the reference corpus are measurements of
somebody else's copyrighted images, and these test files ship; the corpus
readings live with the corpus, in the private benchmark, and this file must stay
free of them.
