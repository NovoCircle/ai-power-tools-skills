"""Does the diagram we produced look like the one we were shown?

`lint.py` answers a different question, and the difference matters enough to
state first. The linter judges a diagram against ITSELF: nothing overlaps, peers
are the same size, spacing is even, labels fit. That is INTRINSIC quality, and it
is the right question when we are composing a layout from structure, because then
nobody has said where anything goes and the only standard available is whether
the result reads well.

This module judges a diagram against a REFERENCE. That is EXTRINSIC fidelity, and
it is the right question when we are reproducing a picture - a diagram drawn in
some other tool, of which all that survives is the image. There the standard is
not "does it read well" but "is it the same diagram".

THE TWO WILL DISAGREE, AND ON A REPRODUCTION THIS ONE WINS.

That is not a wrinkle, it is the central fact. A hand-placed diagram is hand
placed: its boxes are a few units out of alignment, its gaps are irregular, its
widths differ by ten units for no reason. `check_stack_alignment` and
`check_pitch_consistency` will report every one of those, correctly, as defects -
and "fixing" them produces a tidier diagram that is no longer the one we were
asked to reproduce. So a transcription is NOT required to lint clean, and a
caller who gates on `LintReport.clean` for a transcribed diagram has gated on the
wrong thing.

WHAT "ESSENTIALLY THE SAME" IS TAKEN TO MEAN

Similarity, not equality. The same diagram drawn at twice the scale, or shifted
across the canvas, is the same diagram; a reader would not notice and should not
have to. So the comparison fits a single uniform scale and an offset between the
two, and judges what is left over. Three consequences worth being explicit about:

  * A systematic difference - everything 1.4x bigger, everything 30 units right -
    is absorbed by the fit and is not a finding. It shows up as one number
    (`scale`) that a caller can read, rather than being smeared across every
    element as a drift they would have to recognize as systematic themselves.
  * The scale is UNIFORM. Stretching x and y differently changes proportions, and
    that is visible, so it is reported (`aspect-distorted`) rather than absorbed.
  * Rotation is not fitted. A diagram turned on its side is not the same diagram.

THERE IS NO TOLERANCE CONSTANT IN THIS MODULE, DELIBERATELY

Every other threshold in this toolchain is a calibrated constant, and each one is
a small standing debt: it was measured once, against a population that can move.
Here there is nothing to calibrate, because the uncertainty has a single source
and the reading itself knows it.

The produced geometry is exact - we placed it, to the unit. The reference
geometry is read off a picture by eye, and is good to some number of pixels. So
the tolerance IS the reading's precision, declared by the reading (`precision`),
and a difference larger than the reading's own precision is a real difference.
Nothing else is added.

The practical effect is that a reading which cannot be made precisely must SAY so
by declaring a larger precision, which is honest, and every check then loosens
together. A reading that declares a precision it cannot support is the one way to
get a wrong answer here, and that is a property of the reading rather than a
constant somebody has to maintain.

CORRESPONDENCE IS DECLARED, NEVER GUESSED

Each produced object states which reference element it stands for (`ref`). It is
not inferred from the name, because on our own corpus the names deliberately do
not survive: a Sparx sample reproduced as reference content has different element
names by design, and a matcher keyed on names would fail on exactly the diagrams
this exists to check. Name matching is available as an explicit fallback and the
report says when it was used, because "we guessed the correspondence" and "we
were told it" are different confidences and only one of them should be quiet.

An unmatched element on either side is a finding, never a skipped comparison.
