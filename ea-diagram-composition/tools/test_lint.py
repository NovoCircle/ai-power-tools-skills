"""Tests for the diagram linter.

Run from the repository root:

    python -m pytest ea-diagram-composition/tools/test_lint.py -q

Nothing here touches a repository, a COM object or the filesystem.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES AND DOES NOT COVER
---------------------------------------
The geometry rules - overlap, canvas, sizing, pitch, routing - are exercised in
depth by the benchmark harness's own suite, which runs them through
`scoring.score_diagram` against the corpus. Duplicating those cases here would
be two copies of one fact, and this build has already been bitten once by two
copies of a fact agreeing with each other while both were wrong.

So what is tested here is what is NEW and what is STRUCTURAL: the profile
suppression table, the loop's stopping conditions, the report's own contract,
and the layer boundary that makes the module reusable at all. Plus one case per
rule that proves it is wired into `lint_diagram` - not that the rule is correct,
but that it runs.
