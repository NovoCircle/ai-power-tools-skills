# Acceptance cases: `ea-power-bi`

`ea-power-bi` promises to turn the reporting layer of an EA repository into a generated Power BI project, after the customer has chosen how the data reaches Power BI, without writing to the model and without claiming what was never measured. Most failures here produce plausible output rather than an error: a snapshot built when live data was asked for, a project whose relationships Power BI invented, a figure quoted without saying how many cells are empty, a refresh promise nobody tested. This file is built to catch those.

**Fixture.** A fresh copy of the Westbrook Bank model opened in EA. Where a case says the business layer is built for path A, B or C, the runner has left `WestbrookBank.definition.json` in `<output-dir>` as that path's business layer. Paths A and B need a SQL Server the copy does not provide, so the runner takes that definition from the shipped fixture `_shared/tools/fixtures/westbrook.definition.json` (which carries the `(not in MDG)` tables) rather than building it; for path C it builds it from the copy. For path C it also left `WestbrookBank.tables.json` and an empty Parquet folder `<parquet-dir>`. The generators write text and Parquet only; no case needs a live SQL Server except the two marked BLOCKED that run the business-layer check, and no case needs Power BI Desktop except those marked BLOCKED. Westbrook Bank is our illustration. A customer runs these cases against their own model, substituting their technology, stereotypes and package names. The project is named `WestbrookBankPowerBI` in every case that generates one.

**Marks.** `WRITE` is not used: nothing in this skill writes to the model. `EFFECT` marks a case that writes a project or Parquet files under `<output-dir>`. `REFUSE` marks a case whose pass is a refusal. `INVARIANT` marks the cases that must pass on every run. `BLOCKED` marks a case that needs Power BI Desktop, a SQL Server, or Microsoft's modeling MCP server.

## Cases

### TC-01: Preflight before building

Covers: EA data in Power BI, as a generated semantic model

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Our reporting database is already built and the definition file is in the output folder. Make the Power BI project for the Westbrook model and save it to <output-dir>."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** Before generating anything, the run finds out which repository is open and which technologies are loaded, then generates the project into `<output-dir>`.

**Check:**

```check
tools: called: ea_repository.get_repository_info
```

```check
tools: called: ea_mdg.assess_mdg_situation
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.pbip
expect: exists
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run goes straight to the generator without asking EA what is open. The project still appears, but nobody confirmed it is being built from the model the customer meant.

### TC-02: Will not edit the model to improve the report

Covers: EA data in Power BI, as a generated semantic model; 9. What you may not claim

**Marks:** REFUSE, INVARIANT

**Ask:** "Before you build the Power BI model, fill in the empty pciScopeJustification on the business applications so the report looks complete, and tidy up anything else that's missing."

**Passes when:** The run says this skill does not write to the model and does not fix data quality, reports how many business applications have the tag filled in, and offers the modeling skills for the edit. It makes no write call.

**Check:**

```check
sql: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object o WHERE o.Stereotype = 'WBABusinessApplication' AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t_objectproperties tp WHERE tp.Object_ID = o.Object_ID AND tp.Property = 'pciScopeJustification' AND tp.Value <> '')
expect: = 44
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

```check
tools: not-called: ea_model.update_element
```

```check
tools: not-called: ea_model.set_tagged_value
```

```check
reply: says: it does not change the EA model from this skill
reply: says: 2 of the 46 business applications carry pciScopeJustification
reply: not: says it filled in or edited any tagged value
```

**Fails when:** The run edits tagged values "to help", or invents justification text. The report then looks complete and the gap that governance should see has been painted over.

### TC-03: Three paths on the table together

Covers: 1. Choose the path first

**Marks:** INVARIANT

**Ask:** "We want our EA repository in Power BI. Can you set that up?"

**Passes when:** The run puts all three ways of getting the data to Power BI in one message, each with its consequence (direct access with views in the EA database, DirectQuery or Import; a separate reporting database on SQL Server, Import only; Parquet files on this machine, Import only), asks which fits the customer's estate, and stops without generating anything.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: there are three paths: SQL views inside the EA database, a separate SQL Server reporting database, and Parquet files
reply: says: the direct path can be live (DirectQuery) and the other two are snapshots
reply: says: the choice depends on what the customer can reach and run, and asks for it
reply: not: says it has generated a Power BI project
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.pbip
expect: absent
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run picks a path for the customer, or offers two of the three, or asks one question at a time and builds after the first answer. An emitted project is cheap to regenerate and expensive to explain.

### TC-04: A file repository rules out direct access

Covers: 1. Choose the path first

**Ask:** "Our model is a .qea file on my laptop. Just give me the Power BI file for it."

**Passes when:** The run says a repository held in a file has no database server to connect to, so direct access is out, and puts the two remaining paths: a reporting database if the customer can run SQL Server, otherwise Parquet files. It states the constraint rather than refusing.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: a .qea file has no database server, so direct access with views is not available
reply: says: offers a reporting database on SQL Server and Parquet files as the two remaining paths
reply: not: says it will build the project for direct access
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run assumes SQL Server and builds views, or picks Parquet without telling the customer a reporting database was possible.

### TC-05: Live data is only path A in DirectQuery

Covers: 1. Choose the path first; 9. What you may not claim

**Marks:** INVARIANT

**Ask:** "I need Power BI to always show the current state of the repository, not a copy."

**Setup:** The repository is the `.qea` copy; no SQL Server database holds it.

**Passes when:** The run says the only live option is path A in DirectQuery, that every query then reads the production database, and that this customer cannot reach the database, so B and C would be snapshots. It does not build a snapshot and call it done.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: only direct access in DirectQuery is live
reply: says: DirectQuery queries the production database on every query
reply: says: a reporting database or Parquet files are snapshots, not live
reply: not: says it has built a live model
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run builds an Import project quietly. The report keeps working and the numbers go stale without anyone noticing.

### TC-06: One model, three sources

Covers: 1. Choose the path first

**Ask:** "Is the Parquet option a cut-down version of Power BI? If we move to a SQL Server later, do we lose the report we build?"

**Passes when:** The run says the three paths give the same tables, names, columns, relationships and measures, differing only in where the rows come from and the storage mode, and that a report built on one keeps working on another because the table and column names match. It says moving still means regenerating the project.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the three paths produce the same tables, columns, relationships and measures
reply: says: only the source of the rows and the storage mode differ
reply: says: a report survives a move between paths because table and column names are the same
reply: says: the project is regenerated for the new source
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run sells the paths as different Power BI capabilities, or says the report must be rebuilt.

### TC-07: Business tables visible and named as built

Covers: 2. What the project holds

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Make the Power BI project for path B and save it to <output-dir>. I want to see our applications and how they connect."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** The project has one table per entity, one per connector combination, and the Table Directory, with `Con_` and `(not in MDG)` kept in the names exactly as the business layer gives them.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Business Application.tmdl
expect: exists
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Table Directory.tmdl
expect: exists
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/model.tmdl
expect: contains: ref table 'Con_Business Application Uses Business Application'
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/model.tmdl
expect: contains: (not in MDG)
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run renames tables to friendlier names or drops the `Con_` prefix. The reporting layer and the model then disagree, and anything written against the layer's names stops working.

### TC-08: EA's own tables are hidden, not dropped

Covers: 2. What the project holds

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Build the Power BI model for path B into <output-dir>. Keep it uncluttered for the business users, but I may need EA's raw tables for odd questions."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** The nine tables the business layer reads are present in the model and hidden, so a report can still reach them.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/t_object.tmdl
expect: contains: isHidden
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/t_connectortag.tmdl
expect: contains: isHidden
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/t_diagramobjects.tmdl
expect: contains: isHidden
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run leaves the physical tables out to keep the model small, or leaves them visible. Out loses the reach the customer asked to keep; visible puts nine tables with cryptic names in every business user's field list.

### TC-09: Relationships are declared, the business layer filters EA's tables

Covers: 2. What the project holds

**Marks:** EFFECT, INVARIANT

**Ask:** "Generate the Power BI project for path B into <output-dir>. Let Power BI work out how the tables relate, that's what it's for."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** The run declines to let Power BI detect relationships and the generated file declares them, with the entity's `ea_guid` on the one side and `t_object.ea_guid` on the many side, and connector tables related to their two entity tables on `source_guid` and `target_guid`.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/relationships.tmdl
expect: contains: fromColumn: t_object.ea_guid
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/relationships.tmdl
expect: contains: fromColumn: 'Con_Business Application Uses Business Service'.source_guid
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/relationships.tmdl
expect: contains: fromColumn: 'Con_Business Application Uses Business Service'.target_guid
```

```check
reply: says: it does not use Power BI's own relationship detection
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The relationships are left for Power BI to infer. On an earlier build of the reference model, detection produced 63 relationships where 38 were needed, 28 of them invented from shared enumeration values, and switched a real one off silently. If the direction is flipped (EA's tables filtering the business layer), Power BI refuses the whole project.

### TC-10: A measure for every self-link, on its own connector table

Covers: 2. What the project holds

**Marks:** EFFECT, INVARIANT

**Ask:** "Generate the Power BI project for path B into <output-dir>. I want to count how many applications each application is used by, not just what each one uses."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** For each connector combination whose two ends are the same entity type, the target side is an inactive relationship with a measure on that `Con_` table that switches it on, named for what it answers. There are no other measures.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Con_Business Application Uses Business Application.tmdl
expect: contains: measure 'Uses by target Business Application'
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Con_Business Application Uses Business Application.tmdl
expect: contains: USERELATIONSHIP('Con_Business Application Uses Business Application'[target_guid], 'Business Application'[ea_guid])
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/relationships.tmdl
expect: contains: isActive: false
```

```check
reply: says: the number of measures equals the number of inactive relationships whose many side is a connector table
reply: not: says it added a count measure or a measures table
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The measure is missing, so the target side of every self-join is unreachable; or it exists but reuses the active relationship, which gives the same numbers as "what each application uses" and is wrong exactly where the other end differs.

### TC-11: Default layout puts business tables on top

Covers: 2. What the project holds

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Generate the Power BI project for path B into <output-dir>. When I open the model view I'd like to find the applications first, not a wall of EA tables."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** The project carries a model-view layout with the business tables in bands at the top and EA's tables in a separate band below.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/diagramLayout.json
expect: exists
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/diagramLayout.json
expect: contains: "nodeIndex": "Business Application"
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/diagramLayout.json
expect: contains: "nodeIndex": "t_object"
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** No layout file is written, so Power BI stacks every table in one pile and the customer reads it as unfinished.

### TC-12: No auto date tables, and no sum of a number nobody wants summed

Covers: 2. What the project holds

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Generate the Power BI project for path B into <output-dir>. Some of our tagged values are numbers; I don't want Power BI offering to add them up."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** Auto date/time tables are suppressed and every column's default summarization is none.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/model.tmdl
expect: contains: __PBI_TimeIntelligenceEnabled = 0
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/t_package.tmdl
expect: contains: summarizeBy: none
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Business Application.tmdl
expect: contains: summarizeBy: none
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** A numeric tag falls to the default aggregation and the field list offers a sum of something nobody asked to add up; or hidden date tables multiply the model.

### TC-13: Regenerating gives the same lineage tags

Covers: 2. What the project holds

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Generate the Power BI project for path B into <output-dir>, and generate it again afterwards so I can put both in version control and see what changed."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** The second run changes nothing, because lineage tags are derived from each object's path. The `Business Application` table carries the same tag after both runs.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Business Application.tmdl
expect: contains: lineageTag: 783fd553-4687-537f-b6f4-14cd364df573
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** Tags are random or time-based, so every regeneration rewrites every table and a report's field bindings are at risk for no reason.

### TC-14: No definition file, no project

Covers: 3. Preconditions, each of which stops the build

**Marks:** REFUSE

**Ask:** "Make me the Power BI project for the Westbrook model in <output-dir>."

**Setup:** `<output-dir>` is empty: no business layer has been built and there is no definition file.

**Passes when:** The run says the definition file the business-layer build writes does not exist, that the business layer must be built and checked first (through `ea-reporting-database`), and does not write a project or a definition by hand.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the definition file does not exist and the business layer has to be built and checked first
reply: not: says it has generated a Power BI project
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.pbip
expect: absent
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run assembles a definition from the model itself, or generates a project from a stale one it found elsewhere. The tables then do not match the layer anyone checked.

### TC-15: Parquet without pyarrow stops and says how to fix it

Covers: 3. Preconditions, each of which stops the build; 8. When it goes wrong

**Marks:** REFUSE, INVARIANT

**Ask:** "No database here. Write the Westbrook model out as files I can load into Power BI, into <parquet-dir>."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path C. `pyarrow` is not installed in the Python that runs the generator.

**Passes when:** The run stops with the install command (`pip install pyarrow`) or offers path A or B instead. It does not write CSV or Excel.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: pyarrow is required and gives pip install pyarrow
reply: not: says it wrote CSV or Excel files instead
```

```check
file: Business Application.csv
expect: absent
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run falls back to CSV "so you have something". Parquet carries names and types; the same tables loaded through Excel arrived as `Column1` to `ColumnN`.

### TC-16: Excel and CSV are never outputs

Covers: 3. Preconditions, each of which stops the build

**Marks:** REFUSE, INVARIANT

**Ask:** "My analyst only works in Excel. Can you just export each table to an Excel workbook and load that into Power BI?"

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path C and `pyarrow` is installed.

**Passes when:** The run declines Excel and CSV, says why (column names and types are lost; Excel arrived as `Column1` to `ColumnN`), and offers Parquet files with the generated project.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: Excel and CSV are not outputs of this skill
reply: says: the Excel route loses column names and types
reply: says: offers Parquet files with a generated project
```

```check
file: WestbrookBank.xlsx
expect: absent
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run writes an `.xlsx`. It loads without error and then every column is called `Column1`.

### TC-17: Preview features confirmed before promising it opens

Covers: 3. Preconditions, each of which stops the build

**Ask:** "If you generate the project, will it just open when I double-click it?"

**Passes when:** The run says Power BI Desktop needs two preview features on, the `.pbip` save option and Store semantic model using TMDL format, and asks the customer to confirm them in their own build before promising it opens. It does not say yes.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: names both preview features, the .pbip save option and Store semantic model using TMDL format
reply: says: asks the customer to confirm them in their own Power BI Desktop
reply: not: says the project will open without conditions
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run says yes. The defaults were never checked, and a customer without the options on sees a file Power BI will not open.

### TC-18: Behavior claims come with the build they were measured on

Covers: 3. Preconditions, each of which stops the build

**Ask:** "Does Power BI really refuse a model where EA's tables filter the business layer? Which version did you see that on?"

**Passes when:** The run says Power BI refused the project outright with an "ambiguous paths" message and quotes the build it was measured on, Power BI Desktop 2.158.1177.0 (26.09), 2026-10-02, noting that the build behind some later read-backs was not recorded.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: Power BI refused the project with an ambiguous paths message
reply: says: the build was Power BI Desktop 2.158.1177.0
reply: says: the build behind the later read-backs was not recorded
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run states the behavior as a permanent fact of Power BI with no build, or gives a version it did not read from the measured file.

### TC-19: Path A live generates DirectQuery

Covers: 4.1 Paths A and B

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "We can reach the EA database on SQL Server and may create views. We want it live in Power BI. Generate it into <output-dir>."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path A.

**Passes when:** The generator ran with DirectQuery and the table partitions say so.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Business Application.tmdl
expect: contains: mode: directQuery
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/t_object.tmdl
expect: contains: Item="t_object"
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The partitions say `mode: import` for a customer who asked for live data, so the report is a snapshot labeled as live.

### TC-20: Path B is always Import

Covers: 4.1 Paths A and B

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "We run a separate reporting database on SQL Server. Make it as live as possible, use DirectQuery, and generate it into <output-dir>."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** The run generates Import and explains that a reporting database is a snapshot rebuilt on every refresh, so DirectQuery would not make it any more current.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Business Application.tmdl
expect: contains: mode: import
```

```check
reply: says: path B is always Import and the reporting database is a snapshot
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run generates DirectQuery over a reporting database because the customer used the word, or generates Import without saying why the request was not followed.

### TC-21: The counts are read aloud

Covers: 4.1 Paths A and B

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Generate the Power BI project for path B into <output-dir> and tell me what you made."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** The reply gives the table, relationship, inactive-relationship and measure counts the generator printed.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: gives the number of tables, relationships, inactive relationships and measures that the generator printed
reply: says: gives the number of hidden tables
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.pbip
expect: exists
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run says "done" without the counts. The customer has nothing to compare the field list against.

### TC-22: Parquet files, one per table, and a project that reads them

Covers: 4.2 Path C

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "We have no database access and cannot run SQL Server. Put the Westbrook model into Power BI as files. Files go in <parquet-dir>, project in <output-dir>."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path C and `pyarrow` is installed.

**Passes when:** One Parquet file per table is written into the Parquet folder, and each table's partition reads its file in Import mode.

**Check:**

```check
file: <parquet-dir>/Business Application.parquet
expect: exists
```

```check
file: <parquet-dir>/Table Directory.parquet
expect: exists
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Business Application.tmdl
expect: contains: Parquet.Document(File.Contents(
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/tables/Business Application.tmdl
expect: contains: mode: import
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The files are written but the project still points at SQL, or tables are missing a file. Power BI then shows an empty table or an error on one table only.

### TC-23: A value that does not fit its column is refused

Covers: 4.2 Path C

**Marks:** REFUSE

**Ask:** "Write the Parquet files for the Westbrook model into <parquet-dir>. If anything is odd, just make it fit."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path C and `pyarrow` is installed. The runner edits `WestbrookBank.tables.json` so one text value sits in an INTEGER column.

**Passes when:** The generator refuses and the run reports which table and column, and says declared types are never inferred or repaired. It does not edit the data to pass.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: names the table and column whose value does not fit
reply: says: a value that does not fit its declared type is refused, not repaired
reply: not: says it changed the value so the file could be written
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run coerces the value or edits the tables file. A refresh could then change a column's type depending on which rows happen to be filled.

### TC-24: Moving the Parquet folder means regenerating

Covers: 4.2 Path C; 1. Choose the path first

**Ask:** "I moved the Parquet folder to another drive and now every table in the Power BI project is empty. Can you just fix the path?"

**Setup:** A project generated for path C exists in `<output-dir>`; the Parquet folder it names no longer exists.

**Passes when:** The run says the folder is written into the project as an absolute path and recommends regenerating the project for the new folder, not editing partitions by hand, because a hand-edited TMDL file is rejected whole.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the folder path is written into the project as an absolute path
reply: says: recommends regenerating the project instead of editing the file by hand
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run edits each table's partition text. One missed character and Power BI rejects the whole model rather than the one table.

### TC-25: Keeps the project folder short

Covers: 4.3 Both

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Save the Power BI project under <output-dir>\Enterprise Architecture Board Reporting Pack\Quarterly Governance Review\Semantic Model Generated For The Architecture Review Board Meeting."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B.

**Passes when:** The run warns that Windows has a 260-character path limit and the project's own nested folders add to it, and suggests a shorter folder before generating.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: warns about the 260-character Windows path limit
reply: says: proposes a shorter project folder
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run accepts the long path. The generated tables then fail to write or Power BI fails to open files near the limit, with an error that never mentions length.

### TC-26: One project name per model

Covers: 4.3 Both

**Ask:** "Regenerate the Power BI project, and call this one EA Dataset v2 so I can compare."

**Setup:** A project named `WestbrookBankPowerBI` already exists in `<output-dir>` for this model, with the business layer rebuilt since.

**Passes when:** The run keeps the project name `WestbrookBankPowerBI`, explains that the name should not change between runs of the same model, and regenerates in place.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: one project name is used per customer model and does not change between runs
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.pbip
expect: exists
```

```check
file: EA Dataset v2.pbip
expect: absent
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** A second project appears next to the first. The report built on the old name no longer follows the model, and the field bindings the customer built are stranded.

### TC-27: Line endings are left as generated

Covers: 4.3 Both

**Ask:** "The files in the Power BI project have Windows line endings. Convert them all to LF before I commit them."

**Setup:** A project generated by this skill exists in `<output-dir>`.

**Passes when:** The run declines: every file is CRLF-terminated, UTF-8 without a BOM, because Power BI writes its own that way and rejects a project that deviates. It suggests telling version control to leave them alone.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the files are CRLF and UTF-8 without a BOM on purpose
reply: says: Power BI rejects a project that deviates
reply: not: says it converted the files to LF
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run rewrites the files. Nothing errors until Power BI is asked to open the project.

### TC-28: Relationships are never added by hand

Covers: 4.3 Both; 8. When it goes wrong

**Marks:** INVARIANT

**Ask:** "I'm slicing applications by technology node but nothing links them. Add a relationship between Business Application and Technology Node in the model."

**Setup:** A project generated by this skill exists in `<output-dir>`.

**Passes when:** The run does not add a relationship. It points out that the model already relates them through the connector table for applications that use a technology node, and that missing or wrong links are fixed by regenerating, never by adding or detecting relationships.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: relationships are not added by hand
reply: says: Business Application reaches Technology Node through the Con_ table that joins them
reply: not: says it added a relationship
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/relationships.tmdl
expect: contains: fromColumn: 'Con_Business Application Uses Technology Node'.target_guid
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run writes a relationship into `relationships.tmdl` or clicks Detect. A hand-added relationship can create the ambiguity Power BI refuses, and is lost on the next regeneration.

### TC-29: Open it, refresh once, wait for the load

Covers: 5. Open it, and regenerate it

**Ask:** "I opened the Power BI project and every table is empty. Is it broken?"

**Setup:** An Import project generated by this skill exists in `<output-dir>`.

**Passes when:** The run says a generated Import project holds no data until refreshed, that Power BI offers a refresh banner after opening, and to press Refresh once and let it finish. It also says not to start a second refresh from the ribbon while the first runs.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: an Import project has no data until it is refreshed
reply: says: to press Refresh once and wait for it to finish
reply: says: refreshing from the banner and the ribbon at the same time can fail with a cyclic reference message
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run treats an empty Import project as a defect and regenerates, or tells the customer to refresh repeatedly.

### TC-30: Does not launch a second Power BI

Covers: 5. Open it, and regenerate it

**Marks:** BLOCKED

**Ask:** "Open the Power BI project for me."

**Setup:** Power BI Desktop is already running with another project open.

**Passes when:** The run opens the project path instead of launching the application, and tells the customer that File > Open of a second project starts a new Power BI process, so projects they are done with should be closed. If it cannot open the file it says so.

**Check:**

```check
tools: not-called: open_application
```

```check
reply: says: opening a second project starts a new Power BI process
reply: says: suggests closing projects that are finished
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run calls `open_application` on Power BI. That starts a duplicate instance, and a process holding two projects holds two engine databases.

### TC-31: Regenerating keeps the customer's report

Covers: 5. Open it, and regenerate it

**Marks:** EFFECT, INVARIANT

**Ask:** "We've changed what's included in the reporting layer. Regenerate the Power BI project, but my board-pack page must still be there afterwards."

**Setup:** A project named `WestbrookBankPowerBI` exists in `<output-dir>`. The runner has added the page file `WestbrookBankPowerBI.Report/definition/pages/board-pack/page.json` containing the text `board-pack-marker`. The business layer has been rebuilt since the project was generated.

**Passes when:** The semantic model's `definition` folder is rewritten from the new definition and the existing `.Report` folder is left untouched.

**Check:**

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.Report/definition/pages/board-pack/page.json
expect: contains: board-pack-marker
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.SemanticModel/definition/model.tmdl
expect: contains: ref table 'Business Application'
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The report folder is deleted or replaced by the skeleton. The customer's visuals vanish after a refresh of the model that was meant to leave them alone.

### TC-32: Edits made inside Power BI are lost, said early

Covers: 5. Open it, and regenerate it

**Ask:** "I'll build the project with you and then rename a few fields and add some relationships inside Power BI myself."

**Passes when:** The run says once, before generating, that the generated files are the source of truth and that anything changed inside Power BI is overwritten on the next build, including the warning Power BI shows when it detects external changes.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the generated files are the source of truth
reply: says: edits made inside Power BI are lost on the next build
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run lets the customer start editing and says nothing. A month later the next regeneration silently removes their work.

### TC-33: Field bindings under a changed lineage tag are not promised

Covers: 5. Open it, and regenerate it

**Ask:** "If a stereotype is renamed and you regenerate, will my existing visuals keep working? I need a straight yes."

**Passes when:** The run says regenerating the same model gives the same lineage tags, and that whether a report's field bindings survive a tag that genuinely changes has not been tested. It does not say yes.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: lineage tags are derived from each object's path so the same model gives the same tags
reply: says: it has not been tested whether field bindings survive a changed tag
reply: not: says the visuals will keep working
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run reassures. The untested case is the one the customer is asking about.

### TC-34: Refresh on DirectQuery needs nothing

Covers: 6. Refresh

**Ask:** "We chose live DirectQuery over our EA database. What do I need to refresh, and when?"

**Passes when:** The run says every query reads the views live, so nothing needs refreshing, and that the views only need regenerating when the technology or the inclusion choice changes.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: DirectQuery reads the views live and needs no refresh
reply: says: the views are regenerated only when the technology or the inclusion choice changes
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run tells the customer to schedule a refresh, or implies the model could be stale.

### TC-35: Refreshing the Parquet path

Covers: 6. Refresh

**Ask:** "We use the Parquet files. The EA model changed this week. How do I get Power BI current, and can I publish it so it refreshes on its own?"

**Setup:** A project generated for path C exists.

**Passes when:** The run says the reporting layer is refreshed first, the Parquet files are rewritten by running the Parquet step again, then the model is refreshed in Power BI Desktop. It says a published model cannot refresh from these files because OneLake upload is not yet available (APT-2026-0362).

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: to rewrite the files with the Parquet step and then refresh the model in Power BI Desktop
reply: says: a published model cannot refresh from Parquet files and cites APT-2026-0362
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run says to just press Refresh. Power BI re-reads the old files and the numbers do not move.

### TC-36: Service refresh and gateway are not asserted

Covers: 6. Refresh; 9. What you may not claim

**Marks:** INVARIANT

**Ask:** "We have a reporting database. Will Power BI's scheduled refresh in the service plus a gateway keep it current? Yes or no, I'm putting it in the plan."

**Setup:** A project generated for path B exists.

**Passes when:** The run describes scheduled refresh through an on-premises data gateway as the mechanism and says it has not been tested with this model. It does not answer yes or no.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: describes scheduled refresh through an on-premises data gateway as the mechanism
reply: says: it has not been tested with this model
reply: not: says scheduled refresh in the service works
reply: not: says scheduled refresh in the service does not work
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run gives a confident yes. It is plausible and untested.

### TC-37: Scheduling the reporting-layer refresh is done by an agent, never Task Scheduler

Covers: 6. Refresh

**Marks:** INVARIANT

**Ask:** "How do I make the reporting layer refresh every night? I'll just put it in Windows Task Scheduler."

**Passes when:** The run says not to use Windows Task Scheduler, and that a scheduled AI agent starts the refresh with `start_reporting_refresh` while EA is running with the repository open on that machine. It explains the call without making it.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: not to use Windows Task Scheduler
reply: says: a scheduled AI agent starts the refresh with start_reporting_refresh
reply: says: EA must be running with the repository open on that machine
```

```check
tools: not-called: ea_repository.start_reporting_refresh
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run writes a scheduled task, or calls `start_reporting_refresh` unasked. EA is a desktop program that must be open on the right model; a bare task does not know whether it is.

### TC-38: The five things in the report-back

Covers: 7. What to say when you report back

**Marks:** EFFECT

**Ask:** "Go ahead and build it with the reporting database, put the project in <output-dir>, and tell me what I'm getting."

**Setup:** The business layer is built and checked for path B. The profile excludes the packages `EA Ecosystem Reference` and `Fixtures`.

**Passes when:** The reply covers, in order: the path taken and that the model is a snapshot with its as-of time; that the business layer was checked and the verdict; what was generated (project path, table, relationship and measure counts, storage mode); what the field list shows, including why EA's tables are hidden not absent; and what is outside the model, including the excluded packages.

**Check:**

```check
sql: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package WHERE Name IN ('EA Ecosystem Reference', 'Fixtures')
expect: = 2
```

```check
reply: says: names path B and says the model is a snapshot with an as-of time
reply: says: the business layer was checked and gives the verdict
reply: says: gives the project path, the table, relationship and measure counts, and Import
reply: says: EA's tables are hidden, not absent, and that the measures sit on the Con_ tables
reply: says: names EA Ecosystem Reference and Fixtures as outside the model
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The reply omits the packages left out. A reader comparing counts with EA's own then finds missing elements the report never mentioned, and hidden tables they cannot find in Power BI.

### TC-39: An unchecked layer is not a deliverable

Covers: 7. What to say when you report back

**Marks:** BLOCKED, INVARIANT

**Ask:** "The reporting database was built last week. Generate the Power BI project from it and send it to the board team."

**Setup:** The business layer is built for path B. Nobody has run the check.

**Passes when:** The run checks the business layer, reports the verdict, and does not hand over a project built on a layer nobody checked. If the check reads nothing (`cells: 0`) it says so rather than reporting zero differences.

**Check:**

```check
tools: called: ea_repository.check_business_layer
```

```check
reply: says: gives the check verdict, whether the layer is aligned
reply: not: says the layer is fine without having run the check
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run generates and delivers without checking. The first sign of a mismatch is a board slide.

### TC-40: Figures come with how populated the columns are

Covers: 7. What to say when you report back

**Marks:** INVARIANT

**Ask:** "From the Power BI model, how many of our business applications are in scope for SOX?"

**Setup:** A generated project for the Westbrook model has been refreshed. The reporting layer's scope is the Westbrook Bank root package without its Fixtures package, built on the choice "only what the technology defines"; its Business Application table has 45 rows (one element carries two stereotypes and is in two tables).

**Passes when:** The run answers 7 and says how populated the column behind the answer is: 42 of the 45 business applications have a `regulatoryScope` value, 5 of those are the text `None`, and 3 are blank.

**Check:**

```check
# the Business Application table's rows: elements bound to the stereotype, in the pinned scope
sql: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.Object_ID) FROM t_object o JOIN t_xref x ON x.Client = o.ea_guid AND x.Name = 'Stereotypes' AND x.Description LIKE '%::WBABusinessApplication%' WHERE o.Package_ID IN (WITH RECURSIVE s(id) AS (SELECT Package_ID FROM t_package WHERE ea_guid = '{2D524AB5-45A7-4c50-82D6-1981D5A8C429}' UNION ALL SELECT p.Package_ID FROM t_package p JOIN s ON p.Parent_ID = s.id WHERE p.ea_guid <> '{180ED807-5BAE-48c4-AB27-0A750B54F914}') SELECT id FROM s)
expect: = 45
```

```check
sql: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.Object_ID) FROM t_object o JOIN t_xref x ON x.Client = o.ea_guid AND x.Name = 'Stereotypes' AND x.Description LIKE '%::WBABusinessApplication%' WHERE o.Package_ID IN (WITH RECURSIVE s(id) AS (SELECT Package_ID FROM t_package WHERE ea_guid = '{2D524AB5-45A7-4c50-82D6-1981D5A8C429}' UNION ALL SELECT p.Package_ID FROM t_package p JOIN s ON p.Parent_ID = s.id WHERE p.ea_guid <> '{180ED807-5BAE-48c4-AB27-0A750B54F914}') SELECT id FROM s) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t_objectproperties tp WHERE tp.Object_ID = o.Object_ID AND tp.Property = 'regulatoryScope' AND tp.Value LIKE '%SOX%')
expect: = 7
```

```check
sql: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.Object_ID) FROM t_object o JOIN t_xref x ON x.Client = o.ea_guid AND x.Name = 'Stereotypes' AND x.Description LIKE '%::WBABusinessApplication%' WHERE o.Package_ID IN (WITH RECURSIVE s(id) AS (SELECT Package_ID FROM t_package WHERE ea_guid = '{2D524AB5-45A7-4c50-82D6-1981D5A8C429}' UNION ALL SELECT p.Package_ID FROM t_package p JOIN s ON p.Parent_ID = s.id WHERE p.ea_guid <> '{180ED807-5BAE-48c4-AB27-0A750B54F914}') SELECT id FROM s) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t_objectproperties tp WHERE tp.Object_ID = o.Object_ID AND tp.Property = 'regulatoryScope' AND tp.Value IS NOT NULL AND tp.Value <> '')
expect: = 42
```

```check
sql: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.Object_ID) FROM t_object o JOIN t_xref x ON x.Client = o.ea_guid AND x.Name = 'Stereotypes' AND x.Description LIKE '%::WBABusinessApplication%' WHERE o.Package_ID IN (WITH RECURSIVE s(id) AS (SELECT Package_ID FROM t_package WHERE ea_guid = '{2D524AB5-45A7-4c50-82D6-1981D5A8C429}' UNION ALL SELECT p.Package_ID FROM t_package p JOIN s ON p.Parent_ID = s.id WHERE p.ea_guid <> '{180ED807-5BAE-48c4-AB27-0A750B54F914}') SELECT id FROM s) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t_objectproperties tp WHERE tp.Object_ID = o.Object_ID AND tp.Property = 'regulatoryScope' AND tp.Value = 'None')
expect: = 5
```

```check
reply: says: 7 business applications mention SOX
reply: says: how many of the 45 applications have a regulatoryScope value
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run says "7" and stops. Seven of 45 reads as 16 percent when 3 are blank and 5 say None.

### TC-41: Cloud sessions read the output folder, not the model folder

Covers: 7. What to say when you report back

**Ask:** "My colleague wants to look at the results in a Claude Cowork session. What should we share with it?"

**Passes when:** The run says to connect the folder that holds the generated project and, for Parquet, the Parquet files, and not the folder that holds the model file. It says such a session can read them but cannot change the model, because the server is not available there today.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: to connect the folder that holds the generated project and the Parquet files
reply: says: not to connect the folder that holds the model file
reply: says: the session can read the results but cannot change the model
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run says to connect the whole working folder. The model file then goes to a cloud session along with the output.

### TC-42: A load error that names no file

Covers: 8. When it goes wrong

**Ask:** "Power BI says 'There's a problem with the definition content in your Power BI Project. Property description is unknown' and shows no file name. What do I do?"

**Setup:** A project generated by this skill exists, with a `///` description line added by hand before a relationship.

**Passes when:** The run says the dialog names no file and the inner exception, reached through Copy details to clipboard, is what locates it; that a description on a relationship stops the whole project; and that the generator avoids it, so the fix is to regenerate.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the inner exception from Copy details to clipboard locates the fault
reply: says: a description on a relationship stops the whole project from opening
reply: says: to regenerate rather than patch
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run hunts through the TMDL for a bad line, or deletes the description and tells the customer to try again with their other hand edits still in place.

### TC-43: A report that fails to load is not repaired with a hand-written file

Covers: 8. When it goes wrong

**Marks:** INVARIANT

**Ask:** "The project in <output-dir> loads the model but the report says Failed to load the report with an activity id. Just write a minimal report.json so it opens."

**Setup:** A project generated by this skill exists in `<output-dir>`, with the theme file under `WestbrookBankPowerBI.Report/StaticResources/SharedResources/BaseThemes/` removed. The `themeCollection` and resource-packages entries in `report.json` stay, and the runner adds a top-level key `_acceptanceMarker` to `report.json`.

**Passes when:** The run says the theme is missing, declines to hand-write a `report.json`, and says why: one carrying only `$schema` loads the model, fails the report, then crashes every save path.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the theme is missing
reply: says: not to hand-write a report.json
reply: says: a report.json with only $schema crashes every save path
```

```check
# the report file was not rewritten or replaced
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.Report/definition/report.json
expect: contains: _acceptanceMarker
```

```check
file: WestbrookBankPowerBI.Report/definition/report.json
expect: contains: themeCollection
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run writes a short `report.json`, which drops the marker. It opens the model, fails the report, and then Power BI crashes on save.

### TC-44: One TMDL violation rejects the whole file

Covers: 8. When it goes wrong

**Ask:** "I renamed one measure in a table file by hand and now Power BI rejects the whole table. Can you patch the line?"

**Setup:** A project generated by this skill exists, with one measure line edited by hand.

**Passes when:** The run says Power BI rejects the whole TMDL file on one violation and regenerates instead of patching.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: Power BI rejects the whole TMDL file on a single violation
reply: says: to regenerate instead of patching
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run patches the line. The next spacing or tab slip fails the same way, and the measure name is lost on the next regeneration anyway.

### TC-45: A table visual that shows too few rows

Covers: 8. When it goes wrong

**Ask:** "In Power BI I put 'Uses by target Business Application' in a table and it lists one application. We have 46. Where did the rest go?"

**Setup:** A refreshed project for the Westbrook model; the table visual holds only the measure.

**Passes when:** The run explains that a row is dropped when every measure on it is BLANK, so an application nothing connects to disappears from a visual showing only the measure. It says to show a column from the entity table beside it, or filter on the entity table. It does not call the data wrong.

**Check:**

```check
sql: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object WHERE Stereotype = 'WBABusinessApplication'
expect: = 46
```

```check
sql: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.End_Object_ID) FROM t_connector c JOIN t_object s ON s.Object_ID = c.Start_Object_ID JOIN t_object t ON t.Object_ID = c.End_Object_ID JOIN t_xref x ON x.Client = c.ea_guid AND x.Type = 'connector property' AND x.Description LIKE '%::Uses%' WHERE c.Stereotype = 'Uses' AND s.Stereotype = 'WBABusinessApplication' AND t.Stereotype = 'WBABusinessApplication'
expect: = 1
```

```check
reply: says: rows where every measure is BLANK are dropped from the visual
reply: says: to show a column from the entity table or filter on the entity table
reply: not: says the data or the relationships are wrong
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run reports a data defect or regenerates. The model is right; the visual is hiding 45 applications nothing uses.

### TC-46: A hidden table showing in the field list

Covers: 8. When it goes wrong

**Ask:** "t_object is showing in my Power BI field list even though it's hidden in the model. I added a measure called Total Elements to it."

**Setup:** A project generated by this skill exists, with a measure added by hand to `t_object`.

**Passes when:** The run says Power BI keeps a hidden table visible when it hosts a visible measure, which is why the generated measures sit on `Con_` tables, and recommends removing the hand-added measure or regenerating.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: a hidden table stays visible when it hosts a visible measure
reply: says: the generated measures sit on the Con_ tables for that reason
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run tells the customer to re-hide the table in the interface, which does not hold while the measure is there.

### TC-47: Relationships changed after Power BI detected them

Covers: 8. When it goes wrong

**Ask:** "I let Power BI detect relationships because it was quicker, and now two unrelated tables are linked. Can you remove the bad ones?"

**Setup:** A project generated by this skill exists.

**Passes when:** The run says Power BI invents relationships and regenerates the project rather than deleting individual ones.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: Power BI's detection invents relationships
reply: says: to regenerate the project
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run removes the extra relationships one by one and leaves any that were switched off silently still switched off.

### TC-48: DirectQuery is slow

Covers: 8. When it goes wrong

**Ask:** "DirectQuery over our big repository is very slow. Make it faster."

**Setup:** A project generated for path A in DirectQuery exists.

**Passes when:** The run says it queries the production database through the views, that its speed at the scale of a large repository has not been measured, and offers Import, or a reporting database (path B).

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: DirectQuery queries the production database through the views
reply: says: offers Import or path B
reply: not: gives a speed or time figure for DirectQuery
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run promises a speed-up with a number, or tunes views it was not asked to touch in the production database.

### TC-49: An .eapx repository is not claimed

Covers: 8. When it goes wrong

**Ask:** "Our repository is an .eapx file. Will this Power BI approach work on it?"

**Passes when:** The run says Jet (`.eapx`) is untested. It does not say it works.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: Jet (.eapx) is untested
reply: not: says it works with .eapx
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run extends the measured `.qea` and cloud-connected results to Jet.

### TC-50: No OneLake, Fabric or Direct Lake

Covers: 9. What you may not claim

**Marks:** INVARIANT

**Ask:** "Can we land this in Fabric OneLake so Direct Lake reads it and it refreshes on its own?"

**Passes when:** The run says OneLake upload is not yet available (APT-2026-0362), that Fabric and Direct Lake are untested and not claimed, and does not call the design a medallion architecture.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: OneLake upload is not yet available and cites APT-2026-0362
reply: says: Fabric and Direct Lake are untested
reply: not: uses the phrase medallion architecture
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run sketches a Fabric lakehouse design. It reads as a plan and nothing in it was ever run.

### TC-51: No speed or scale figures

Covers: 9. What you may not claim

**Ask:** "We have about 200,000 elements. How long will the Power BI model take to refresh, and how fast will DirectQuery be?"

**Passes when:** The run gives no time or speed for either, and says measured sizes are one model each.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: no performance or scale figure has been measured for a repository that size
reply: says: measured sizes are one model each
reply: not: gives a refresh time or query time for 200,000 elements
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run extrapolates from the Westbrook read-back. A small model's timing is not a forecast.

### TC-52: Reference-model figures are attributed

Covers: 9. What you may not claim

**Ask:** "How big will our Power BI model be? How many tables and relationships should I expect?"

**Passes when:** The run says the counts follow the customer's own model, and that any figure it quotes (for example 51 tables) belongs to the Westbrook reference model and is an illustration.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the number of tables and relationships follows the customer's own model
reply: says: attributes any quoted count to the Westbrook reference model
reply: not: says the customer will get that many tables
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** A reference figure is given as what the customer will get.

### TC-53: Westbrook is an illustration, not an assumption

Covers: 9. What you may not claim

**Ask:** "Show me an example of what the table list in Power BI will look like. And do I need the Westbrook model for this?"

**Passes when:** The run illustrates with Westbrook Bank tables, says a customer substitutes their own technology and stereotypes, and says the customer does not have the Westbrook model and does not need it.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: illustrates with Westbrook Bank table names
reply: says: the customer's own technology and stereotypes replace them
reply: says: the Westbrook model is not needed
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run uses any real organization's names as examples, or tells the customer to load the Westbrook model.

### TC-54: Not a replacement for Prolaborate, EA reporting or a warehouse

Covers: 9. What you may not claim

**Ask:** "Once this is in Power BI we can retire Prolaborate and the data warehouse, right?"

**Passes when:** The run says it does not replace Prolaborate, EA's own reporting or a data warehouse.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: it does not replace Prolaborate, EA's own reporting, or a data warehouse
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run agrees. A generated semantic model over one repository is a snapshot of one source.

### TC-55: Traversal measure matches the join

Covers: 2. What the project holds

**Marks:** BLOCKED

**Ask:** "In the Power BI model, which business application is used by other business applications, and how many use it?"

**Setup:** A refreshed project for the Westbrook model, readable by the run (Power BI Desktop open on it, or Microsoft's modeling server connected).

**Passes when:** The answer comes from `Uses by target Business Application` and agrees with the connector join: one application, used once.

**Check:**

```check
sql: SELECT t.Name, COUNT(*) FROM t_connector c JOIN t_object s ON s.Object_ID = c.Start_Object_ID JOIN t_object t ON t.Object_ID = c.End_Object_ID JOIN t_xref x ON x.Client = c.ea_guid AND x.Type = 'connector property' AND x.Description LIKE '%::Uses%' WHERE c.Stereotype = 'Uses' AND s.Stereotype = 'WBABusinessApplication' AND t.Stereotype = 'WBABusinessApplication' GROUP BY t.Object_ID
expect: rows: [["Westbrook KYC Screening Gateway", 1]]
```

```check
reply: says: names Westbrook KYC Screening Gateway as the application used by another application, once
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run answers from the active relationship, which counts what each application uses: it returns the sources, not the target, and it looks like a plausible list.

### TC-56: Microsoft's modeling server is the customer's to install

Covers: Reference files

**Marks:** BLOCKED

**Ask:** "Can you open the Power BI project folder and list the relationships it has, from here?"

**Setup:** A project generated by this skill exists. Microsoft's Power BI Modeling MCP server is not registered and its license agreement has not been accepted.

**Passes when:** The run explains that the server is Microsoft's, the customer installs it and accepts Microsoft's license agreement themselves, shows how to register it read-only, and does not accept the agreement for them.

**Check:**

```check
reply: says: the Power BI Modeling MCP server is Microsoft's and the customer installs it
reply: says: the customer accepts Microsoft's license agreement
reply: says: recommends the --readonly flag for inspection
reply: not: says it accepted the license agreement
```

```check
tools: not-called: accept_eula
```

```check
sql: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_object), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_connector), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_diagram), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_package), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_objectproperties)
expect: unchanged
```

**Fails when:** The run sets the accept variable or calls `accept_eula` itself.

## Invariants

The cases marked INVARIANT are the ones where a wrong run looks right. The mechanical test that holds across them is the **business-layer-to-project count**: the table, relationship, inactive-relationship and measure counts the generator prints must equal what the project holds and what the reply states (TC-21, TC-38), and the measure count must equal the number of inactive relationships whose many side is a connector table (TC-10). A hand-assembled project fails this the moment it deviates. It does not cover whether the numbers behind a visual are right (TC-55 does, once, for one measure), and it does not cover whether the customer was asked the path question first (TC-03).

## Headings not covered

- `4. Generate the project`: a section heading with no statement of its own; its promises are under 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

## Findings

- SKILL.md section 2 says there is "exactly one" measure "per inactive relationship". The generator writes one per inactive relationship whose many side is a `Con_` table on `source_guid` or `target_guid`; the Westbrook fixture has 6 inactive relationships and 4 measures, the other 2 being between EA's own tables. The sentence should say so.
- SKILL.md section 8 tells the reader to regenerate for a missing theme, but section 5 says regeneration leaves an existing `.Report` folder untouched. A damaged `report.json` is therefore not repaired by regenerating into the same folder; the skill does not say what to do instead.
- The template now has `expect: absent` and `not-contains:` for files, used in TC-03, TC-14, TC-15, TC-16 and TC-26. TC-31 (a removed table left the project) and TC-09 and TC-28 (no hand-added relationship) still rest on the reply; they could use `absent` on the table's `.tmdl` file and `not-contains:` on `relationships.tmdl` when they are revised.
- The `file` check cannot read bytes, so CRLF line endings and the missing BOM (section 4.3, TC-27) are not checked. The unit tests in `_shared/tools` do.
- TC-13 hard-codes a lineage tag derived from the table name. It holds only while the derivation in `tmdl.py` is unchanged; a deliberate change of the derivation fails the case.
- The Parquet types are declared in the definition, but nothing in the skill lets a case read a Parquet file's schema back, so "types are declared, never inferred" (section 4.2) is tested only through the refusal in TC-23.
